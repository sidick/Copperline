# Getting started

Copperline can be run as a native desktop application or in the browser
at [copperline.dev/try](https://copperline.dev/try/). This chapter covers
system requirements, installation, building from source, and initial setup.

## System requirements

- **Rust (source builds only):** 1.95 or newer; CI uses the stable toolchain.
- **Supported operating systems:** macOS, Linux, and Windows.
- **Graphics backend:** Metal on macOS, Direct3D 12 on Windows, and Vulkan on Linux
  (see [](#vulkan-is-required-on-linux)).
- **Linux build dependencies:** `sudo dnf install alsa-lib-devel systemd-devel gcc`
  on Fedora, or `sudo apt install libasound2-dev libsystemd-dev gcc` on Debian/Ubuntu.
- **Boot ROM:** Copperline includes the open-source [AROS](http://www.aros.org/)
  Kickstart replacement and boots it by default. It also supports official
  Commodore Kickstart ROMs (1.3, 2.05, 3.1, plus CDTV and CD32 extended ROMs)
  and [DiagROM](https://www.diagrom.com/). Use a single-file 512 KiB image or
  a 256 KiB Kickstart 1.x image; Copperline mirrors the latter across its
  512 KiB ROM window. See [ROM formats](configuration.md#top-level).

## Installing on macOS (Homebrew)

To install using Homebrew:

```sh
brew tap copperlinehq/copperline https://github.com/CopperlineHQ/Copperline
brew install copperline
```

To build directly from the latest development commit:

```sh
brew install --HEAD copperline
```

Pre-built macOS application bundles (`Copperline-X.Y.Z-macos-universal.dmg`) are
also available on the [releases page](https://github.com/CopperlineHQ/Copperline/releases).
Mount the disk image and copy `Copperline.app` to `/Applications`. If macOS
quarantine blocks initial launch, right-click the app and choose **Open**, or run:

```sh
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Copperline.app
```

## Installing on Linux

### Flatpak

Flatpak packages include all runtime dependencies and work across distributions:

```sh
flatpak install flathub dev.copperline.Copperline
flatpak run dev.copperline.Copperline
```

### AppImage

Standalone AppImage binaries are provided on the
[releases page](https://github.com/CopperlineHQ/Copperline/releases):

```sh
chmod +x Copperline-*.AppImage
./Copperline-*.AppImage
```

(vulkan-is-required-on-linux)=
### Vulkan is required on Linux

On Linux, presentation uses the Vulkan backend via `wgpu`. If no Vulkan adapter
is found, the application exits at launch.

Modern GPUs generally provide hardware Vulkan support through Mesa drivers.
For virtual machines or older hardware, install the software Vulkan driver (lavapipe):

- **Arch Linux:** `sudo pacman -S vulkan-swrast`
- **Debian / Ubuntu:** `sudo apt install mesa-vulkan-drivers`
- **Fedora:** `sudo dnf install mesa-vulkan-drivers`

The Flatpak build bundles lavapipe by default.

## Installing on Windows

Download `Copperline-X.Y.Z-win-x64.zip` or `Copperline-X.Y.Z-win-arm64.zip`
from the [releases page](https://github.com/CopperlineHQ/Copperline/releases),
matching your Windows architecture. Extract the whole archive and run
`copperline.exe`; keep the bundled ROMs and other assets alongside it.

### The console window

`copperline.exe` is one program doing two jobs, and it is built for the
command line: run it from a prompt and it behaves like any other tool there.
The shell waits for it, and `--help`, the log and every
[headless flag](headless.md)'s output go to that terminal.

Started from Explorer or the Start menu, there is no prompt to write to, so
Copperline closes the console window Windows opens for it and
leaves only the emulator. The window may still flash briefly: Windows puts it
on screen before Copperline gets to run.

(command-line-tools)=
## Command-line tools

Every package also carries two companion programs: `copperline-ctl`, the
[control protocol](../debugger/control.md) client whose `--mcp` and `--dap`
modes serve coding agents and the [VS Code extension](../debugger/vscode.md),
and `copperline-import-uae`, the [WinUAE/Amiberry/FS-UAE config
converter](import-uae.md). Where they land depends on the package:

| Package | Location |
|---|---|
| Homebrew | On PATH, next to `copperline`. |
| macOS dmg | Inside the bundle, `Copperline.app/Contents/MacOS/`. Add that directory to PATH or name the files in the VS Code settings. |
| Windows zip | Next to `copperline.exe` in the extracted folder. Add the folder to PATH or name the `.exe` files in the VS Code settings. |
| AppImage | The separate `Copperline-X.Y.Z-<arch>-tools.tar.gz` release asset. Unpack it anywhere; set `COPPERLINE_BIN` to the AppImage path so `copperline-ctl` can launch the emulator. |
| Flatpak | In the sandbox: `flatpak run --command=copperline-ctl dev.copperline.Copperline ...` (and likewise `copperline-import-uae`). |

`copperline-ctl` launches the `copperline` beside it when one is there; the
[DAP chapter](../debugger/dap.md) lists the full lookup order.

## Building from source

```sh
cargo build --release
```

```{warning}
Use the binary in `target/release/` for emulation. `--release` is a Cargo
build option, not a Copperline command-line flag. Unoptimized debug builds
are too slow for real-time emulation.
```

To run the test suite:

```sh
cargo test                          # Unit tests (no external assets required)
cargo test --release -- --ignored   # Integration tests (requires local test media)
```

For the optimized native CI suite, including the deterministic golden renders,
use `cargo test --profile ci --locked`. The `ci` profile inherits release
settings but disables LTO and uses parallel code generation to compile test
executables faster. Its binaries are in `target/ci/`; normal builds and
performance benchmarks continue to use `--release`. Add `--timings` to write
a build report to `target/cargo-timings/cargo-timing.html`.

## First boot

Run Copperline from the terminal:

```sh
./target/release/copperline
```

When started with no arguments and no `copperline.toml` in the current directory,
Copperline displays the interactive launcher screen where you can configure
machine models, memory, storage, and peripherals.

With no saved default, the launcher starts with an Amiga 500 (Rev 6A): ECS
8372A Agnus, OCS 8362 Denise, 512 KiB chip RAM, 512 KiB slow RAM, and the
bundled AROS Kickstart replacement. **Save default** remembers your settings
for later launches. `--factory` ignores that saved default; an explicit
`--config` or a local `copperline.toml` still takes precedence.

To boot directly into a specific Kickstart ROM or configuration file:

```sh
./target/release/copperline path/to/kickstart.rom
./target/release/copperline --config path/to/copperline.toml
```

You can also specify machine parameters via command-line flags:

```sh
./target/release/copperline --model A1200 --fast 8M KICK31.ROM
```

See [](configuration#command-line-overrides) for the full list of CLI flags.

```{figure} ../images/kick13-insert-disk.png
:alt: Kickstart 1.3 insert-disk screen
:width: 75%

Kickstart 1.3 waiting for a boot floppy.
```

To mount a floppy disk image on boot:

```toml
rom = "KICK13.ROM"

[floppy.df0]
path = "Game.adf"
```

Supported floppy formats include ADF, ADZ (gzip-compressed ADF), single-file ZIP,
DMS, extended ADF, IPF, and SCP. In interactive sessions, disk images can also
be inserted via drag-and-drop into the emulator window.

## Example configuration

A fully commented example configuration is available in `copperline.example.toml`
in the root of the repository. Copy it to `copperline.toml` or pass it via `--config`:

```sh
./target/release/copperline --config copperline.example.toml
```

## Logging and crash reports

Set `RUST_LOG=debug` or `RUST_LOG=trace` in the environment to enable detailed logging.

If an unhandled panic occurs, Copperline writes diagnostic output and a backtrace
to `copperline-crash.txt` (attempted next to the executable first, falling back to
the current working directory, and then to the system temporary directory).
Please include this file when reporting bugs.
