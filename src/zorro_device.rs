//! The functional-Zorro-board boundary.
//!
//! A [`ZorroDevice`] is an expansion board that *does something* beyond
//! presenting RAM: it answers register reads/writes in its configured window,
//! advances on the colour clock, may assert an interrupt line, and may bus-
//! master DMA into Amiga memory. The in-tree A2091 SCSI controller and CDTV
//! DMAC implement it, and the WASM plugin host (`src/wasmboard.rs`) implements
//! it over a guest module so functional boards can be authored out of tree.
//!
//! [`DeviceHost`] is the narrow host-services view a device is handed on every
//! call. Today it exposes guest memory for DMA; capability hooks (CD audio,
//! networking) are added alongside the devices that need them. It also owns the
//! single DMA address decode (chip / slow / motherboard / accelerator /
//! Zorro-board RAM) that the A2091 and CDTV bus masters previously each
//! open-coded. Zorro II masters only drive the low 24 bits; a Zorro III master
//! like the A4091 reaches the 32-bit motherboard and accelerator banks too.
