# Release Checklist

Copperline is currently released as a source application rather than a
crates.io library, so the root package remains marked `publish = false`.

## Before Creating the Public Repository

1. Create the public repository from a clean tree with rewritten history.
2. Confirm the tracked tree has no copyrighted ROM, disk, hard-disk, or CD
   images:

   ```sh
   git status --short
   git ls-files | rg -n '\.(rom|ROM|adf|ADF|adz|ADZ|dms|DMS|hdf|HDF|scp|SCP|cue|CUE|bin|BIN|iso|ISO|u12|U12|u13|U13|wasm|WASM|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|pdf|zip|7z|lha|lzx)$'
   ```

   Expected tracked binary files are:

   - `assets/brand/*.png`
   - `assets/aros/aros-amiga-m68k-rom.bin` and
     `assets/aros/aros-amiga-m68k-ext.bin`, the bundled AROS boot ROMs
     (APL-licensed; see `assets/aros/README.md`)
   - `assets/fmv/copperline-fmv.rom`, the GPLv3+ open CD32 Full Motion Video
     cartridge ROM built reproducibly from `fmv-rom/` (see
     `assets/fmv/README.md`)
   - `assets/services/services_rom.bin`, the guest-side host-filesystem
     handler built from `guest/services/`
   - `assets/hrtmon/hrtmon.rom`, HRTMon 2.39 assembled reproducibly from
     the upstream source by `hrtmon-rom/build.sh` (GPL-2.0-or-later; see
     `assets/hrtmon/README.md` and `LICENSE`)
   - `assets/a4091/a4091_cdfs.rom`, the upstream A4091 v42.39 autoboot ROM
     (mixed redistribution notices and an exact component inventory are in
     `assets/a4091/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt`)
   - `assets/hostsocket/hostsocket_rom.bin` and
     `assets/hostsocket/hostsocket_plugin.wasm`, the bundled HostSocket board
     artifacts built from `guest/hostsocket/` and `crates/hostsocket-plugin/`
   - `docs/images/*.png`; review provenance before release when these change
   - `timing-test/*.bin` probe programs: `boot.bin`, `test.bin`,
     `audprobe-*`, `bfprobe`, `bltprobe-*`, `bplprobe-*`, `clxprobe`,
     `dblpal-*`, `ddfprobe-*`, `fwdprobe`, `hamprobe-*`, `probesrv`,
     `rdprobe`, `regprobe-*`, and `sprprobe-*`; each is built from its
     adjacent `.asm`
   - `timing-test/golden/*.png`, the blessed golden renders for
     `tests/probe_golden.rs`
3. Confirm local assets are still ignored:

   ```sh
   git check-ignore -v KICK13.ROM AmigaTestKit.adf cdtv_single.bin
   ```

## Version bump

`crates/copperline-web`, `crates/copperline-player`,
`crates/copperline-libretro`, `crates/cputest-runner`, and
`crates/hostsocket-plugin` are separate workspaces with their own committed
`Cargo.lock` files, so a root build never refreshes them. The web, player,
and libretro crates pin the root `copperline` version by path; the cputest
runner independently pins the published `m68k` dependency, and the HostSocket workspace pins the
dependency graph used to build the committed
`assets/hostsocket/hostsocket_plugin.wasm`. If a manifest changes without
regenerating its matching nested lock, every `cargo build --locked` in that
crate fails at the release tag, and tags are immutable so the breakage cannot
be fixed after the fact (issue #219: the `v0.12.0` tag shipped
`crates/copperline-web/Cargo.lock` still pinning `copperline 0.11.0`).

In the same commit as any version bump, resync the affected nested locks
and commit them:

```sh
(cd crates/copperline-web && cargo update -p copperline) # root version bump
(cd crates/copperline-player && cargo update -p copperline)
(cd crates/copperline-libretro && cargo update -p copperline)
(cd crates/cputest-runner && cargo update -p m68k)       # m68k requirement change
(cd crates/hostsocket-plugin && cargo update)            # its manifest/dependencies change
```

The `Lockfile sync` workflow (`.github/workflows/locks.yml`) runs these
checks on every pull request, push to `main`, and `v*` tag push, so a tag
cut from a commit with a stale lock turns red within about a minute --
delete and re-cut the tag if that happens. The pre-tag check below is still
part of the checklist so the drift never reaches the tag at all; the
v0.12.0 breakage happened precisely because the tag was cut from a fresh
bump commit before any CI had run against it.

## Checks

Run these before tagging a source release:

```sh
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked
```

Confirm every nested workspace lockfile is in sync (fails if a version bump
missed one; see "Version bump" above):

```sh
(cd crates/copperline-web && cargo tree --locked > /dev/null)
(cd crates/copperline-player && cargo tree --locked > /dev/null)
(cd crates/copperline-libretro && cargo tree --locked > /dev/null)
(cd crates/cputest-runner && cargo tree --locked > /dev/null)
(cd crates/hostsocket-plugin && cargo tree --locked > /dev/null)
```

Build the documentation:

```sh
cd docs
myst build --html --ci --strict --check-links
myst build --pdf --ci --strict
test -s _build/exports/copperline.pdf
```

On a `v*` tag the `Docs release PDF` workflow rebuilds the PDF and attaches
`Copperline-X.Y.Z-manual.pdf` to the GitHub Release automatically (the
everyday PDF build check stays in the `docs` job in ci.yml). To back-fill a
release whose tag predates the workflow, run it from the Actions tab against
`main` with `release_tag` set to that tag.

## Homebrew formula

This repository is its own Homebrew tap (`Formula/copperline.rb`). After
tagging a release, update the formula so `brew install copperline` picks up
the new version:

```sh
VER=X.Y.Z
curl -fsSL "https://github.com/CopperlineHQ/Copperline/archive/refs/tags/v$VER.tar.gz" | shasum -a 256
```

Set `url` to the `v$VER.tar.gz` tarball and `sha256` to the printed digest.
Check the edited formula before committing:

```sh
ruby -c Formula/copperline.rb
brew style ./Formula/copperline.rb
```

After pushing the formula update, refresh the tap and smoke-test the named
formula. Recent Homebrew releases reject path-based formula audit/install
commands unless the formula is loaded from a tap.

```sh
brew update
brew audit --strict --formula copperlinehq/copperline/copperline
brew upgrade --build-from-source copperlinehq/copperline/copperline
brew test copperlinehq/copperline/copperline
```

## Linux: Flatpak and AppImage

Linux distribution uses two channels (see `packaging/`).

**Flatpak / Flathub** (`packaging/flatpak/`) is the primary channel. After a
release commit lands, generate the untracked vendored crate list and point the
manifest at the tag:

```sh
./packaging/flatpak/generate-cargo-sources.sh
```

Set `tag:` and `commit:` in `dev.copperline.Copperline.yaml` to the release,
add a `<release>` entry to `dev.copperline.Copperline.metainfo.xml`, then push
the same change to the `flathub/dev.copperline.Copperline` repository (the
Flathub app repo created at first acceptance). The `Flatpak` workflow builds
and lints the bundle the same way Flathub does. First-time submission steps are
in `packaging/flatpak/README.md`.

**AppImage** (`packaging/appimage/`) is the no-install fallback. The `AppImage`
workflow builds it on `ubuntu-22.04` and, on a `v*` tag, attaches
`Copperline-X.Y.Z-<arch>.AppImage` to the GitHub Release automatically. To
build one by hand on a Linux host:

```sh
./packaging/appimage/build-appimage.sh
```

## Windows

Windows distribution is a portable zip per architecture
(`packaging/windows/`). The `Windows` workflow builds them natively on
`windows-latest` (x86-64) and `windows-11-arm` (ARM64) and, on a `v*` tag,
attaches `Copperline-X.Y.Z-win-x64.zip` and
`Copperline-X.Y.Z-win-arm64.zip` to the GitHub Release automatically. The
same workflow runs the full release build on pull requests that touch the
code, so it doubles as the Windows build check for both architectures (the
main CI runs on macOS and Linux).

The zips are self-contained: the MSVC C runtime is linked statically (see
`.cargo/config.toml`) so they need no Visual C++ Redistributable, and the
bundled AROS ROM sits in a sibling `aros\` folder that `romsearch.rs` probes
first; the other bundled ROM assets (`fmv\`, `a4091\`, `a2091\`, `lide\`,
`hrtmon\`) are staged beside it the same way. To build one by hand on a
Windows host (add
`-Target aarch64-pc-windows-msvc` for the ARM64 zip):

```pwsh
packaging/windows/build-zip.ps1
```

## macOS disk image

The prebuilt macOS download is a disk image (`packaging/macos/`): a
drag-to-Applications `Copperline.app` wrapped in a `.dmg`. The `macOS` workflow
builds each architecture's binary on its own `macos-latest` runner, joins them
into the bundle in a package job, and, on a `v*` tag, attaches
`Copperline-X.Y.Z-macos-universal.dmg` to the GitHub Release automatically.
Homebrew (above) remains the build-from-source channel; the disk image is the
no-compiler alternative.

The app bundle is a universal binary (the workflow builds both
`aarch64-apple-darwin` and `x86_64-apple-darwin` and `lipo`-joins them), so one
download runs natively on Apple Silicon and Intel. The bundled AROS ROM lives in
`Contents/Resources/aros`, which `romsearch.rs` probes, so it runs out of the
box. The image is ad-hoc signed (required for the arm64 slice to launch) but is
intentionally NOT Developer ID signed or notarized, so first launch trips
Gatekeeper; the right-click-Open workaround is in the image's `README.txt`. To
build one by hand on a macOS host:

```sh
./packaging/macos/build-dmg.sh
```

## Libretro cores

The `Libretro` workflow builds and tests Linux x86-64, macOS Apple Silicon,
and Windows x86-64 cores. On a `v*` tag, it attaches a versioned ZIP for
each platform to the GitHub Release. Each ZIP includes the core, its
`.info` file, WHDLoad support archives, licences, and installation notes.
These cores are loaded manually in RetroArch; see `docs/guide/libretro.md`.

Before announcing the release, confirm the DMG, AppImage, network helper,
both Windows ZIPs, PDF manual, and all three libretro ZIPs are attached,
and that the browser and documentation publishing workflows have passed.

## Crate packaging

`cargo package --offline` can be used to inspect and verify the source archive
layout after the dependencies are cached. The published `m68k` dependency is
crates.io-compatible and needs no path-dependency exception.
