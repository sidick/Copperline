//! Warp launch: `--run program` boots straight into an ordinary Amiga
//! executable from the host, with no disk image, no Workbench, and no
//! support assets.
//!
//! The staging mirrors the WHDLoad direct boot (src/whdload.rs) at its
//! smallest: two host directories mounted live through the services board
//! (src/filesys.rs). The boot volume contains a generated
//! `S/Startup-Sequence` and small redistributable `C:` commands for the
//! bare Kickstart 1.3 CLI. Later ROMs can use their internal commands.
//!
//! - `<config dir>/run/boot-<pid>/` (volume `RunBoot:`, boot priority 6):
//!   the generated `S/Startup-Sequence` and bundled commands. Regenerated on every launch and
//!   per-process, so concurrent instances never rewrite each other's
//!   live-mounted volume; stale siblings are swept by age.
//! - the program's own directory (volume `RunProg:`, writable): mounted in
//!   place, so a freshly built executable is picked up on the next launch
//!   and anything the program writes lands next to it on the host.
//!
//! Unlike WHDLoad no machine is derived: the session boots whatever the
//! configuration and CLI flags describe (the bundled AROS ROM by default).
//!
//! The perceived instant boot comes from [`WarpLaunch`]: a windowed session
//! starts unpaced with live audio muted, polls the LoadSeg tracker
//! (src/amigaos.rs) once per emulated frame, and returns to real-time
//! pacing the moment the guest OS loads the target program -- the same
//! trick the BartmanAbyss WinUAE fork calls warp launch, minus its
//! per-title scan. A completion marker echoed by the Startup-Sequence
//! catches a program too short-lived for the frame poll to see, and a
//! fallback deadline keeps a misspelled or crashing Startup-Sequence
//! from warping (silently) forever.
