//! The bundled ZZ9000 SDK crypto board (`[zz9k]`): a register-compatible
//! subset of the MNT ZZ9000's "SDK v2" service platform (CORE + MEMORY +
//! CRYPTO services plus DIAG_READ) whose crypto runs host-side instead of
//! on the real card's ARM core. The unmodified SDK Amiga-side stack -- its
//! transport library, the zz9k-* tools, and the accelerated AmiSSL build --
//! detects and drives this board exactly as it does real hardware, giving
//! guest TLS-era crypto host-speed offload. The register/opcode contract is
//! docs/internals/zz9k.md.
//!
//! The board is an ordinary WASM plugin board (crates/zz9k-plugin, hosted
//! by `src/wasmboard.rs`) whose module is embedded in the binary -- the
//! same bundling as the HostSocket board ([`crate::hostsocket`]). It is
//! pure compute (no DMA, no network, no host sockets), so fitting it keeps
//! a machine fully deterministic and replay-safe.
