//! WASM-hosted functional Zorro board: an external plugin compiled to
//! `wasm32` that implements a board's behaviour, run under wasmtime.
//!
//! A plugin module exports its behaviour and imports a small set of host
//! services (see the ABI below); its entire mutable state lives in WebAssembly
//! linear memory, which is a flat byte array that snapshots and restores
//! exactly like the Amiga RAM the emulator already serializes. That is why WASM
//! fits Copperline's determinism / save-state contract.
//!
//! ## Module ABI
//!
//! Exports the plugin provides (all optional except `memory`):
//! - `memory`                       the linear memory (required)
//! - `init()`                       called once after instantiation
//! - `read(off: i32, size: i32) -> i32`   register read in the board window
//! - `write(off: i32, size: i32, value: i32)`  register write
//! - `tick(cck: i32)`               advance by `cck` colour clocks
//! - `int2() -> i32`                INT2 (PORTS) line state, 0/1
//! - `int6() -> i32`                INT6 (EXTER) line state, 0/1
//!
//! Imports the host provides in module `env` (capability-gated):
//! - `log(ptr: i32, len: i32)`                      always available
//! - `config_get`/`resource_len`/`resource_read`    always available
//! - `resource_write(name_ptr, name_len, off, in_ptr, len: i32) -> i32`
//!   requires the `resource_write` capability
//! - `dma_read(addr: i32, ptr: i32, len: i32)`      requires the `dma` capability
//! - `dma_write(addr: i32, ptr: i32, len: i32)`     requires the `dma` capability
//! - `net_send(ptr: i32, len: i32)`                 requires the `net` capability
//! - `net_recv(ptr: i32, cap: i32) -> i32`          requires the `net` capability
//! - `resolve_start(name_ptr: i32, name_len: i32) -> i32`        requires `resolve`
//! - `resolve_poll(id: i32, out_ptr: i32) -> i32`                requires `resolve`

//! `dma_read` copies `len` bytes from Amiga address `addr` into the plugin's
//! linear memory at `ptr`; `dma_write` copies the other way. Both use the
//! shared 24-bit chip/slow/Zorro decode in [`crate::zorro_device`].
//! `net_send`/`net_recv` move whole Ethernet frames between the plugin's
//! linear memory and the manifest's configured [`NetConfig`] backend.
//! `resource_write` is `resource_read`'s counterpart: it copies `len` bytes
//! out of the plugin's linear memory at `in_ptr` into the named file resource
//! at offset `off`, write-through to the host file the resource was loaded
//! from, and returns the byte count written or a negative
//! `RESOURCE_WRITE_*` code. It lets a board that owns persistent media (a
//! virtual PC hard disk image, say) keep it. The resource is named, never
//! pathed, so the writable set is exactly the files the manifest already
//! chose; a write never extends a resource past the length `resource_len`
//! reports. File resources are live external state outside the save-state
//! contract either way (they are reopened by path, not snapshotted), so this
//! does not weaken determinism -- it surfaces that non-determinism as writes
//! rather than as a stale cache.
//!
//! `resolve_start`/`resolve_poll` ask the host to resolve a hostname via
//! its own OS resolver on a background thread (`getaddrinfo` blocks, and
//! this store runs synchronously on the main emulation thread) --
//! `resolve_start` returns a request id, `resolve_poll` is a non-blocking
//! poll of it (-2 pending, -1 failed, or 0 with the resolved IPv4 address
//! written into the plugin's own linear memory at `out_ptr`). Like `net`,
//! using either makes a board non-deterministic.
//!
//! `sock_*` gives the plugin direct, non-blocking passthrough to a real
//! host OS socket -- the Amiberry-style alternative to implementing TCP/IP
//! over `net` (see `HOSTSOCKET-HOST-BACKEND-PLAN.md`). `sock_open` takes
//! BSD `domain`/`type` values (`AF_INET` = 2; `SOCK_STREAM` = 1 or
//! `SOCK_DGRAM` = 2, nothing else) and returns a plugin-scoped handle, or a
//! negative BSD-style errno. `sock_connect`'s `ip` is a big-endian IPv4 address (the
//! same byte order every other address in this ABI uses); like a real
//! non-blocking BSD `connect()`, it returns `0` on an immediate connect (rare
//! for TCP) or `-EINPROGRESS`, and the plugin polls completion with
//! `sock_poll`. `sock_send`/`sock_recv` return a byte count, `0` for
//! `sock_recv` at EOF, or a negative errno (`-EAGAIN` when the call would
//! block -- there is no separate blocking mode; the guest-side blocking
//! doorbell loop is what turns this into a blocking call, same as it
//! already does for the smoltcp backend). `sock_poll` returns a bitmask:
//! bit 0 readable, bit 1 writable, bit 2 error-pending (check with
//! `sock_getopt(..., SO_ERROR, ...)`, which reads and clears the host socket's
//! pending error). All host errno values are normalized to the guest's
//! BSD-style numbering at this boundary (matching
//! `crates/hostsocket-plugin`'s own `EAGAIN = 35` etc. -- the two are
//! hand-kept in sync, same as the guest-ROM/plugin window offsets already
//! are), so the plugin never sees a platform-specific errno. `sock_bind`/
//! `sock_listen` are plain non-blocking BSD `bind()`/`listen()`.
//! `sock_accept` is a non-blocking `accept()`: a fresh, already-nonblocking
//! handle for the new connection, or `-EAGAIN` when nothing is waiting.
//! `sock_local_addr`/`sock_peer_addr` write a socket's bound local (resp.
//! remote) address (4-byte IPv4 + 2-byte port, both big-endian) into the
//! plugin's own linear memory -- the former mainly so a `bind()` to port
//! `0` can learn the real ephemeral port the OS assigned, the latter so
//! `accept()`'s own address out-param can report a real value instead of
//! a placeholder. `sock_sendto`/`sock_recvfrom` are UDP's real
//! `sendto()`/`recvfrom()` -- an explicit per-call destination/sender
//! address instead of `sock_connect`'s single recorded peer, using the
//! same `sock_local_addr`/`sock_peer_addr` 6-byte address layout for the
//! sender `sock_recvfrom` reports. `sock_setopt`/`sock_getopt` apply a
//! small, real subset of setsockopt()/getsockopt() directly to the host
//! socket (SO_REUSEADDR/SO_KEEPALIVE/SO_RCVBUF/SO_SNDBUF/TCP_NODELAY, plus
//! a real SO_ERROR "get pending error and clear" on the getopt side) --
//! see their own doc comments below for exactly which options and why the
//! rest stay plugin-side roundtrip storage. `sock_dup` is a real `dup(2)`
//! of the host socket -- a fresh, independently closeable handle sharing
//! the same underlying connection, backing Dup2Socket/ReleaseCopyOfSocket
//! on a host-backed fd with no manual refcounting on either side of this
//! ABI. Using this capability makes a board non-deterministic, and
//! grants it far more than `net` does: a plugin holding it can reach
//! anything the host process can reach, on the host's own network
//! identity.
//!
//! ## Determinism
//!
//! The wasmtime engine is configured for determinism (NaN canonicalization, no
//! SIMD/threads). Persistent mutable state must live in linear memory: snapshots
//! capture linear memory and its page count, not WebAssembly globals (the
//! shadow-stack pointer is unwound to a constant between calls, so it needs no
//! capture). Save-state replay of a plugin is only guaranteed within one
//! wasmtime build; the version is pinned in `Cargo.toml`.
