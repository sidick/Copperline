Copperline - portable Windows build
====================================

Copperline is a cycle-driven Amiga emulator (OCS/ECS/AGA).

Running
-------
This is a portable build: no installation is required. Unzip it anywhere and
run copperline.exe. It needs no administrator rights and no Visual C++
Redistributable (the C runtime is linked statically into the executable).

On first launch Windows SmartScreen may show "Windows protected your PC"
because the executable is not code-signed. Click "More info", then
"Run anyway" to start it.

Boot ROM
--------
With no ROM of your own, Copperline boots the bundled AROS open-source
Kickstart replacement, found in the aros\ folder next to the executable. AROS
is freely redistributable; see aros\LICENSE. To use a real Kickstart instead,
point a config file at it, or load it at runtime from the menu
(Load Kickstart ROM...).

Copperline's bundled open Full Motion Video ROM ships in the fmv\ folder.
The CD32 profile leaves that cartridge slot empty, as a stock CD32 does;
set fmv = true in a config (or press Fit on the launcher's FMV row) to fit
the module with it.

Configuration
-------------
copperline.example.toml is a starting point. Copy it, edit the paths to your
own Kickstart ROM and disk/hard-disk images, and launch with:

    copperline.exe --config your-config.toml

Run "copperline.exe --help" for the full command-line surface.

Command-line tools
------------------
Two companion programs sit next to copperline.exe:

  copperline-ctl.exe         Client for the control protocol (scripting and
                             AI agents), the MCP server mode (--mcp) and the
                             Debug Adapter Protocol adapter (--dap) used by
                             the VS Code extension. It launches the
                             copperline.exe beside it, so keep them together
                             or point the copperline.emulatorExecutable
                             setting at the emulator. Add this folder to
                             PATH, or set copperline.ctlExecutable to the
                             full path of copperline-ctl.exe.
  copperline-import-uae.exe  Converts a WinUAE, Amiberry or FS-UAE config
                             file into a Copperline TOML config:
                             copperline-import-uae.exe --from winuae
                                 --in game.uae --out game.toml

Portable data
-------------
By default, quick-save slots and host preferences are kept under
%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Copperline so they survive replacing or moving this
folder. To keep them inside this folder instead, create an empty file named
portable.txt next to copperline.exe and restart Copperline. Quick-save slots
will then be in the states subfolder; controller mappings, WHDLoad data and
other host preferences will also stay here. Delete portable.txt to return to
Documents; existing files are not moved automatically.

Bridged Ethernet
----------------
User-mode NAT works with no additional software. Direct bridged Ethernet
requires Npcap from https://npcap.com/; Copperline loads it only when a bridge
backend is selected. Use "copperline.exe --list-net-interfaces" to find the
exact adapter identifier. Wi-Fi bridging is best-effort because many access
points reject frames carrying the Amiga's separate source MAC address.

Troubleshooting
---------------
If Copperline crashes, it writes the crash details to copperline-crash.txt
next to copperline.exe (or, if that folder is read-only, to the current
directory or the system temporary directory). The file is replaced at the
first crash of each run, and any further crashes in the same run are
appended to it; please attach it when reporting a bug at
