# Direct executable launching (`--run`)

The `--run` flag allows you to boot Copperline directly into an Amiga executable
located on your host filesystem without preparing a disk image or Workbench installation.
This is particularly useful when developing with an Amiga cross-compiler toolchain:

```sh
copperline --run build/hello
copperline --run build/hello --run-args "-level 2"
copperline --run build/hello --run-stack 32768 --run-detach
```

To turn an already linked hunk executable into a standard 880 KiB floppy, use
`copperline-ctl exe2adf PROG --boot [--out PROG.adf]`. It writes the executable
and `S/Startup-Sequence` through the same OFS directory-tree writer used by
Copperline's virtual filesystems; `--boot` installs the AmigaDOS boot block.
Omit `--boot` for a mountable data disk. The executable's filename must be 1-30
Latin-1 characters and cannot contain `:` or `/`; the generated script uses the
same single-byte name stored in the disk directory.

## How it works

When `--run` is used, Copperline mounts two virtual filesystem volumes using the
host filesystem interface:

1. **`RunBoot:`** (Boot priority 6) -- A dynamically generated boot volume containing
   an `S/Startup-Sequence` that sets the current directory, launches the specified
   executable, and records a completion marker holding the program's AmigaDOS
   return code when it exits. This volume
   is created in a per-process temporary staging directory. Bundled `C:FailAt`,
   `C:CD`, `C:Stack`, `C:Echo`, and `C:Done` executables supply the commands
   missing from a bare Kickstart 1.3 ROM (`Done` writes the return code the CLI
   keeps in `cli_ReturnCode`); `C:Execute` supplies the detached script handoff
   on later ROMs. No Workbench command files are needed.
2. **`RunProg:`** (Read/Write) -- The host directory containing the target executable.
   The guest loads the binary directly from this volume, and any output files written
   by the program are saved to the same host directory.

Other machine settings are configured normally via configuration files or CLI flags.
`--run-stack BYTES` accepts 2048 through 2147483644 bytes and emits an
AmigaDOS `Stack` command before the executable; invalid sizes are rejected
before booting.
`--run-detach` launches it through `Run >NIL: <NIL:` and closes the boot CLI
(Kickstart 2.0+ or AROS).
By default, the bundled AROS Kickstart replacement is used on the standard machine profile:

```sh
copperline --model A1200 --fast 8M KICK31.ROM --run build/demo
```

(exit-on-return)=
## Guest exit status (`--exit-on-return`)

With `--exit-on-return`, the session ends the moment the program's return
code lands in the completion marker, and Copperline's own exit status is that
code (clamped to 0-255). Windowed sessions close their window; headless runs
need no capture flag to bound them:

```sh
copperline --run build/tests --exit-on-return --noaudio; echo $?
```

If the run ends for another reason first (the last `--screenshot-after`
fired, the window was closed) before the program returned, the status is 4.
A program that never returns therefore needs a bounding flag such as
`--screenshot-after 60 /tmp/end.png` to turn into a 4 rather than an
endless run. The generated script sets `FailAt 2147483647` so no return code
aborts it before the marker is written; a non-zero code takes precedence
over a failed `--expect-screenshot` (status 3), a zero one does not hide it.
The full status table is in [Headless](headless.md#exit-statuses).
`guest/run-tools/retcode` returns the number given as its argument, for
checking the plumbing end to end.

## Fast-forward boot (Warp mode)

In interactive windowed sessions, `--run` automatically enables warp mode during boot.
(For configurations booting from media rather than `--run`, warp boot is also available via
`--warp-boot` / `--warp-until`; see [Configuration](configuration.md).)
The emulator runs unthrottled with audio muted until the guest OS loads the executable
(tracked at the `LoadSeg` call before executing the first instruction). Once loaded,
emulation and audio immediately return to normal real-time playback.

Additional operational notes:

- **Early termination:** If the program completes execution quickly, the completion
  marker the `Startup-Sequence` writes disables warp mode.
- **Boot timeouts:** If the program fails to load within 60 emulated seconds (for example,
  due to a crash during OS initialization), warp mode disengages so the system state can
  be inspected.
- **File naming:** Target filenames must use printable ASCII characters without quotes (`"`),
  colons (`:`), or slashes (`/`). Spaces in executable names are supported and quoted automatically.
- **Manual override:** Pressing the warp toggle shortcut (`Cmd+W` / `Alt+W`) cancels
  the automatic warp phase and every programmatic warp hold at once, returning
  to real-time execution.
- **Programmatic warp:** A control-protocol client (`warp.set {"on": true}`, see
  [Control Protocol](../debugger/control.md)), a GDB client (`monitor warp on`,
  see [GDB](../debugger/gdb.md)), and the guest program itself (`warpmode(1)` /
  `warpmode(0)` through the [uaelib trap](#uaelib-trap) below, e.g. during heavy
  computation or asset loading) each hold warp independently. All mute live
  audio while engaged; `warp.set {"on": false}`, `monitor warp off`, or
  `warpmode(0)` release only that holder, real time returns when the last hold
  goes, and the shortcut returns to real time regardless.
- **Physical floppy drives:** If a physical floppy drive (FluxBridge) is attached, warp
  mode is disabled to match the physical drive rate.
- **Headless mode:** Headless capture runs (`--screenshot-after`, `--dump-frames`) run
  unthrottled by default and work with `--run`.

## Debugging

When launched with `--gdb`, Copperline halts execution at the entry point of the loaded
program before the first instruction runs:

```sh
copperline --run build/hello --gdb :2345
m68k-amiga-elf-gdb hello.elf -ex "target remote :2345" -ex continue
```

When halted, the GDB stub reports the base address of the first hunk for symbol loading
via `add-symbol-file`. The GDB monitor command `monitor segments` lists all hunk addresses;
`monitor return-to-program` runs out of the Kickstart ROM window after an OS call.

The [control protocol](../debugger/control.md) gets the same break-at-entry: with
`--run`, `--control` and `--control-gui` arm a one-shot `loadseg` stop for the
program, and `segments.list` reports its hunk addresses at that stop. Scripts can
also arm their own `loadseg` breakpoint to catch every load.

For an IDE, the [Debug Adapter Protocol](../debugger/dap.md) server does all of
this by itself: a VS Code (or nvim-dap) launch configuration naming the program
starts Copperline, stops at the entry point, and debugs by source line from the
executable's own debug information.

`--coverage FILE` turns the same load-to-exit window into lcov line and
function coverage of the program, written when it exits or the run ends; see
[Guest code coverage](../debugger/profiling.md#guest-coverage).

(uaelib-trap)=
### WinUAE-compatible `uaelib` trap

WinUAE's boot ROM provides guest programs with a lightweight service interface,
the "uaelib" trap at `$F0FF60`. Cross-compiler toolchains and templates (such
as `vscode-amiga-debug`) use this trap for helpers like `warpmode()`, `KPrintF()`,
and `debug_register_*()`. Copperline implements the same ABI at the same address,
allowing code written for that template to work unmodified.

Guest code checks the instruction word at `$F0FF60` (`0x4EB9` for a `JSR`, or
WinUAE's A-line `0xA00E`) and invokes the address as a C function, passing the
function index as the first stack parameter and receiving the return value in D0:

```c
long (*UaeConf)(long fn, int index, const char *param, int len, char *out, int outlen)
    = (long (*)(long, int, const char *, int, char *, int))0xf0ff60;
if (*(UWORD *)UaeConf == 0x4eb9 || *(UWORD *)UaeConf == 0xa00e) {
    char out;
    UaeConf(82, -1, "warp true", 0, &out, 1);   /* warpmode(1) */
}
```

| Function | WinUAE meaning | Copperline |
|---|---|---|
| 13 | `ExitEmu`: quit the emulator | Ends the session cleanly at the next frame boundary: the window closes, a headless run stops, and the process exits with status 0 (or 3 if a screenshot expectation had failed). No arguments; returns 1. `guest/uaelib-test/exitemu` calls it. |
| 82 | `uae-configuration`-style `"key value"` line | `warp true` / `warp false` (also `yes` / `no`) toggles warp mode. Parameters like `cpu_speed` and `*_cycle_exact` are accepted as no-ops. Returns 0. |
| 86 | Debug log string | Printed to the host console as `DBG: <text>` (shared with serial output), streamed to control-protocol `debug` subscribers as `event.debug`, and mirrored into the debugger console. Returns 1. |
| 88 | `debug_cmd` multiplexer | `debug_register_bitmap` / `_palette` / `_copperlist` and `debug_unregister` register guest assets, viewable in the Frame Analyzer (Resources and Memory tabs), exportable as PNG there or with `debug.resource.export`, searchable via `palette.dump` / `copper.list`, and listed with the console `DBGRES` command; `debug_start_idle` / `debug_stop_idle` report guest idle time in `debug.idle` and `event.frame.guest_idle_cck`. Overlay drawing (`debug_clear` / `debug_rect` / `debug_filled_rect` / `debug_text` on a 768x576 virtual canvas) renders on screen in the window (excluded from captures and recordings). `debug_load` / `debug_save` are disabled by default; see below. |
| others | version, disks, RTG, ... | Return 0 with no side effects. |

- Enabled by default; set `[emulation] uaelib = false` to leave `$F0FF60` unmapped.
- Set `[emulation] uaelib_files = true` to let `debug_load(address, name)` and
  `debug_save(address, size, name)` access the host. Paths are confined below
  the `--run` program directory: absolute paths, `..`, symlink escapes, invalid
  UTF-8, unmapped guest-memory ranges, and transfers over 16 MiB are rejected.
  `debug_load` returns the byte count, or 0 when disabled or rejected. This is
  an explicit trust decision for the launched guest and has no effect without
  a `--run` program directory.
- A CDTV extended ROM occupies `$F00000` and covers this address space.
- Without the trap, `KPrintF` falls back to Exec `RawPutChar` and emits over the serial port.
- Guest-initiated warp mutes live audio; `warpmode(0)` releases the guest's hold, and `Cmd+W` / `Alt+W` ends every hold.
- The return latch is shared: uaelib calls from interrupt handlers between a main-thread doorbell write and result read may overwrite D0.

## Kickstart compatibility

Normal `--run` launches support bare Kickstart 1.3, later ROMs, and bundled
AROS. The generated boot volume supplies small GPL-licensed 68000 versions of
`FailAt`, `CD`, `Stack`, `Echo`, and `Done` for the 1.x CLI. Working-directory
changes, arguments, `--run-stack`, and the completion marker with its return
code work without Workbench.
The program itself must also use APIs available on the selected ROM.

`--run-detach` still requires Kickstart 2.0+ or AROS: the bundle does not
replace the `Run` and `EndCLI` commands used by detached launches. The bundled
`Execute` handles the generated child script without parameter substitution
or nested scripts.
Kickstart 1.2 lacks filesystem autoconfig support and cannot boot the
host-directory volumes, even though the bundled commands use 1.x APIs.
