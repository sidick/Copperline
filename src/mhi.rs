//! MHI: a virtual MPEG (MPEG-1/2/2.5 Layer III) audio decoder board. See
//! `docs/internals/mhi.md` -- the contract this module implements exactly
//! -- for the register protocol, and `docs/internals/toccata.md`/
//! `docs/internals/audio.md` for the mixer-cadence pattern this module
//! reuses (the causal native-rate producer / non-causal mixer-rate
//! resampler split, and per-rate `Resampler` caching).
//!
//! ## Decoder choice
//!
//! Decoding uses [Symphonia](https://crates.io/crates/symphonia-bundle-mp3)'s
//! MPEG audio decoder (`MpaDecoder`, MPL-2.0), with only its Layer III
//! feature enabled to match the board's `CAPS` register. Pure Rust matters
//! here: the previous decoder (`minimp3-sys`) compiled a vendored C copy of
//! minimp3 whose SIMD detection broke the whole default build on MSVC ARM64
//! hosts (issue #474), and it was the last C compile in the default feature
//! set.
//!
//! `MpaDecoder` is packet-based -- each call decodes exactly one whole MPEG
//! frame handed to it as a `Packet` -- but the board is fed an arbitrary
//! byte queue by doorbell-committed descriptors, so [`Decoder`] carries its
//! own packetizer: it hunts for a Layer III frame header, computes the
//! frame's exact byte length from the header fields (the same ISO 11172-3
//! slot arithmetic Symphonia's own header parser applies, so a frame this
//! module cuts is never rejected for its length), and feeds one frame per
//! decode call. Bytes before a frame candidate, headers whose declared
//! frame then fails to decode (fake syncs inside junk, corrupt encodes),
//! free-format frames (bitrate index 0 -- not a CAPS-declared capability,
//! and unsupported by Symphonia), and non-Layer-III frames are all consumed
//! as junk, the resync-across-garbage behaviour a real decoder exhibits and
//! `docs/internals/mhi.md`'s "Undecodable bitstream content" specifies.
//!
//! Determinism: everything register-visible -- descriptor pacing,
//! completion counts, interrupts, `STATUS` -- derives from integer header
//! parsing (frame length, sample rate, sample count) and from decode
//! success/failure, which Symphonia decides in pure bitstream/integer
//! logic; none of it depends on decoded sample values. Emulated-machine
//! behaviour therefore stays reproducible byte-for-byte across platforms.
//! The decoded PCM itself is deterministic run-to-run on any one platform,
//! but a few of Symphonia's precomputed tables call `powf`, whose last-ulp
//! rounding may differ between platform libm implementations, so
//! `--audio-wav` captures of MHI audio are guaranteed identical per
//! platform rather than across operating systems (decoded samples feed
//! only the audio mix, never register state or timing).
//!
//! ## Savestates
//!
//! The decoder's cross-frame state (Layer III bit reservoir, IMDCT overlap,
//! and the polyphase-synthesis delay line) is genuine machine state --
//! restoring mid-stream without it would audibly glitch the next frame or
//! two. Symphonia keeps that state private, so rather than serializing
//! decoder internals, [`Decoder`] retains the raw bytes of the most
//! recently submitted frames (`history`, a few KiB) and a restore
//! re-decodes them into a fresh decoder, discarding the output
//! ([`DecoderSnapshot`]). That reproduces the live decoder's state exactly
//! because every piece of cross-frame state is a function of the trailing
//! few frames alone: the bit reservoir holds at most the trailing 2048
//! bytes of main data (a frame's `main_data_begin` can reach back at most
//! 511 of them), the IMDCT overlap is fully rewritten by each decoded
//! frame, and the synthesis filterbank's 16-block delay line is shallower
//! than one frame's 36 blocks -- and the history is kept deep enough to
//! cover all of it: byte/frame floors for the reservoir span, plus a hold
//! on the last two *decoded* frames so a run of rejected header-shaped
//! junk (which touches only reservoir state) cannot evict the frames the
//! overlap/synthesis state actually came from (`WARMUP_HISTORY_*`,
//! `Decoder::trim_history`). The board
//! additionally keeps every not-yet-decoded byte of every queued descriptor
//! (`bitstream`/`desc_lengths`) and the in-flight decoded frame's un-played
//! sample tail (`current_frame`), so a save/restore cycle reproduces an
//! uninterrupted run's output exactly -- proved by
//! `tests::savestate_round_trip_reproduces_an_uninterrupted_runs_output`.
