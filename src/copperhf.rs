//! copperhf.device: a register-level virtual block-storage board (board +
//! register protocol, TD64/NSD/`HD_SCSICMD` command coverage, disk-change
//! handling, asynchronous worker-thread I/O). See `COPPERHF-DEVICE-PLAN.md`.
//!
//! Up to [`NUM_UNITS`] units, each an optional backing image, are addressed
//! by a raw unit number (not a guest `Unit` pointer -- see
//! `guest/copperhf/copperhf_board.h`) through a doorbell/completion-queue
//! protocol modelled on real trackdisk-style hardware. A request handed to
//! [`CopperhfBoard::write`] via `CHF_DOORBELL` is answered asynchronously (M5):
//! the doorbell handler only reads the request header and copies data *out*
//! of guest memory (write payloads); the real sector-level file I/O runs on a
//! worker thread, and every guest-visible effect -- `io_Error`/`io_Actual`,
//! read data landing in guest memory, the completion pointer appearing on
//! `CHF_COMPLETE_GET`, INT2, and `TD_EJECT`'s media-mask/change-counter
//! bookkeeping -- is applied on the emulation thread inside [`tick`], never
//! from the worker thread and never from the doorbell write itself. INT2 is
//! asserted whenever `CHF_IRQ_ENABLE` is set and either the completion queue
//! is non-empty or a unit's media has changed and not yet been acked
//! (`CHF_CHANGED_MASK`). "Present" (a slot is configured) and "media" (the
//! slot currently has something in it) are tracked separately, so `TD_EJECT`
//! and a runtime CCP `copperhf.eject` behave like pulling a disk out of a
//! still-attached drive rather than unplugging the drive itself.
//!
//! # Determinism (the M5 invariant)
//!
//! The emulated core is deterministic and byte-for-byte reproducible
//! regardless of host speed, and this board must not break that: every
//! guest-visible effect of a request occurs at an emulated time that is a
//! pure function of emulated time, never of how fast the host's file I/O
//! happened to finish. The doorbell handler ([`CopperhfBoard::dispatch_request`])
//! never writes a guest-visible result and never pushes a completion; it
//! only reads the request and copies write payloads out of guest memory
//! (both scoped to the emulation thread -- the worker thread never touches
//! guest memory, per [`DeviceHost`]'s own contract). Every request's due
//! time is therefore, by construction, "the first `tick()` call after its
//! own doorbell write" -- and [`tick`] blocks on the worker's result channel
//! until every request already in flight when it runs has actually
//! delivered its result, applies that result to guest memory/registers, and
//! only then pushes the completion pointer. A slow disk therefore costs
//! host wall-clock time inside that block; it can never change *which*
//! emulated tick a completion becomes visible at, because the blocking
//! happens after the tick has already been reached, not before. All
//! requests ride one FIFO pipeline end to end (one doorbell-ordered
//! `VecDeque` on the board, matched positionally against one single-
//! threaded worker's own strictly-ordered output), so completions always
//! surface in doorbell order exactly as M1-M4, including commands with no
//! file I/O at all (they still take a slot in the same queue). `TD_EJECT`
//! is the one command whose *decision* (should this actually eject) is made
//! at doorbell time (`io_Length != 0`, a guest-visible input field that
//! cannot change), but whose *execution* (dropping the worker's own file
//! handle) is deferred all the way into the worker's own queue position, so
//! it can never race ahead of or fall behind file I/O queued against the
//! same unit; its board-side bookkeeping (media mask, change counter,
//! `CHF_CHANGED_MASK`) is then applied at drain time alongside everything
//! else.
//!
//! # Ownership and quiescing
//!
//! The worker thread owns the real backing files: `units` is an
//! `Arc<Mutex<[Option<ScsiDisk>; NUM_UNITS]>>` the worker locks only while
//! performing one request's actual file I/O (or dropping a unit for
//! `TD_EJECT`). The board never locks it while a request could be in
//! flight; it only touches the mutex from [`attach_unit`]/[`hot_attach_unit`]/
//! [`eject_unit`], which assert the pipeline is already quiesced (empty),
//! never contending with the worker. Everything a register read needs
//! (`present`, a `media` cache mirroring "does the worker's slot hold a
//! disk", and each attached unit's `total_sectors`) is cached board-side, so
//! `CHF_UNIT_PRESENT`/`CHF_UNIT_MEDIA`/`CHF_UNIT_BLOCKS` reads never take the
//! lock and never contend with in-flight I/O.
//!
//! [`CopperhfBoard::quiesce`] blocks until every in-flight request has
//! surfaced (the same drain loop `tick()` runs, just repeated until the
//! queue is empty). The save-state path calls it before serializing (see
//! `Bus::copperhf_quiesce`, invoked from `Emulator::save_state`), and the
//! CCP hot attach/eject handlers (`src/control/exec.rs`) call it before
//! touching a unit, so a resumed state -- always captured with an empty
//! pipeline -- behaves byte-identically to an uninterrupted run, and a hot
//! attach/eject never races the worker's own view of the unit table.
//!
//! # Bounded queue and deadlock safety
//!
//! The doorbell-to-worker job channel is a bounded `SyncSender`
//! ([`WORKER_QUEUE_CAPACITY`]): if the guest floods doorbells faster than
//! the worker drains them, the doorbell write blocks the emulation thread
//! briefly (backpressure). This is deterministic-safe because the worker
//! thread never calls back into the emulation thread and never waits on
//! anything but its own job queue and the file I/O it is doing -- it cannot
//! need the emulation thread to make progress, so the emulation thread
//! blocking on it can never deadlock.
//!
//! The register offsets, IOStdReq field offsets, command numbers, and error
//! codes below all mirror `guest/copperhf/copperhf_board.h`; keep the two in
//! sync. The guest-visible protocol is unchanged from M4.
