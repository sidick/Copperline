# Build a Copperline macOS disk image: a drag-to-Applications Copperline.app
# wrapped in a .dmg. Run from a macOS host (or CI); see
# .github/workflows/macos.yml.
#
# What it does:
#   1. Builds the release binary for both Apple architectures with the pinned
#      dependency graph and lipo-joins them into one universal binary, so a
#      single download runs natively on Apple Silicon and Intel. With
#      PREBUILT_DIR set the cargo step is skipped and the per-architecture
#      binaries are taken from that directory instead (the macOS workflow
#      compiles each slice on its own runner and packages them here).
#   2. Stages a Copperline.app bundle: the universal binary in Contents/MacOS
#      beside the copperline-ctl (control protocol / MCP / DAP client) and
#      copperline-import-uae (config converter) companions, lipo-joined the
#      same way; the icon and AROS ROM in Contents/Resources. romsearch.rs
#      probes a bundle's Contents/Resources/aros first, so the bundled AROS
#      ROM is found with no configuration, and copperline-ctl launches the
#      copperline next to it.
#   3. Ad-hoc code-signs the bundle. lipo strips the per-slice signatures Rust
#      attaches on macOS, and an unsigned arm64 binary will not launch on Apple
#      Silicon at all, so a signature is mandatory even when it is ad-hoc.
#   4. Lays out a .dmg with the app and an Applications symlink, named
#      Copperline-<version>-macos-universal.dmg to mirror the
#      AppImage/Windows/Homebrew version naming so release assets are
#      self-describing.
#
# This build is intentionally NOT signed with a Developer ID or notarized, so
# first launch trips Gatekeeper; packaging/macos/README.txt (shipped in the
# image) explains the right-click-Open workaround.
#
# Override knobs (env):
#   MACOS_UNIVERSAL=0   build only the host architecture (faster local builds)
#   PREBUILT_DIR=<dir>  skip the cargo build and lipo <dir>/<target>/<binary>
#                       for each target and shipped binary instead
#   OUTPUT=<path>       final .dmg file name
