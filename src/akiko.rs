//! Akiko (CD32 gate array) at $B80000: identification, the
//! chunky-to-planar port, NVRAM lines, and the CD-ROM controller.
//!
//! Register layout, command protocol, and DMA behaviour follow WinUAE's
//! akiko.cpp, the de-facto reference for this undocumented chip:
//!
//! - $B80000.L  ID $C0CACAFE (the CD32 ROM C2P probe checks $CAFE at +2).
//! - $B80004.L  INTREQ (read-only; per-source clear rules below).
//! - $B80008.L  INTENA (only the top byte is writable).
//! - $B80010.L  data DMA base (16 sector slots of 4 KiB each).
//! - $B80014.L  misc DMA base: RX ring at +0, subcode at +$100, TX ring
//!   at +$200 (256-byte rings indexed by the inx registers).
//! - $B80018/19/1A  subcode offset / TX index / RX index (read).
//! - $B8001D/1F  TX/RX ring stop offsets (write; also clear the
//!   matching DMA-done interrupt and restart the DMA).
//! - $B80020.W  PBX: sector-slot enable mask (writes OR in; the
//!   transferred slot's bit reads back clear).
//! - $B80024.L  FLAGS (enable, PBX, TXD/RXD DMA, subcode, raw, ...).
//! - $B80028.B  PIO command/response port (unused by the ROM).
//! - $B80030/32 NVRAM I2C lines (SCL bit 7, SDA bit 6, direction
//!   register at $32) with a 24C08 EEPROM behind them.
//! - $B80038.L  C2P port (8 longwords in, 8 planar longwords out).
//!
//! The drive itself is the CD32's Chinon: commands arrive as
//! checksummed byte strings through the TX ring, responses return
//! through the RX ring. Implemented commands: noop, stop, pause,
//! unpause, multi (seek/play/read), LED, SubQ, and status/firmware.
//! Data sectors DMA into chip RAM as 2352-byte raw frames at 75 (x2
//! speed: 150) sectors per second. CD audio playback streams decoded
//! CD-DA sectors into the host mixer ring (44.1 kHz, the mixer's native
//! rate) and sends the drive's start/end notification packets.
