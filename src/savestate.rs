//! Versioned save states: snapshot and restore the full emulated machine.
//!
//! A state captures everything the deterministic core needs to resume
//! exactly where it left off: the CPU core, the whole `Bus` (RAM, ROM,
//! chipset, CIAs, floppy images in memory, expansion boards, CD state),
//! and the machine-level timing carries. Host-side state is deliberately
//! excluded and survives the load instead: audio/serial sinks, debugger
//! instrumentation, and diagnostic trace files. File-backed hard-drive and
//! CD images are stored as paths and reopened on load, so their sector
//! contents are NOT part of the state -- a guest that wrote to a hard
//! drive after the snapshot will see those writes after restoring too.
//!
//! Save and load must happen at an emulated-frame boundary; mid-frame the
//! beam-event capture buffers and slice accounting are not in a resumable
//! state. The emulator wrappers (`Emulator::save_state`/`load_state`) are
//! called from the frame loop between frames, which satisfies this.
//!
//! File format: an 8-byte magic, a little-endian u32 format version, an
//! (uncompressed) bincode `MachineDescriptor` naming the machine the state was
//! produced on, then a zlib stream of bincode-encoded components in the fixed
//! order written by `M68kMachine::write_state`. The descriptor lets a load
//! detect that the state belongs to a different machine than the running
//! config and reconfigure the host to match it; the serialized components
//! already carry the actual hardware, so the machine itself always rebuilds
//! from the state regardless.
//!
//! `save`/`load` name a file; `save_to_writer`/`load_from_reader` are the
//! same format over any byte stream, for hosts without a filesystem (the
//! browser build keeps its states in a download or IndexedDB).

// Version history:
//   1: initial format
//   2: keyboard MCU model replaced the Bus kbd_queue byte path
//   3: keyboard MCU clock-based handshake timing (state shape change)
//   4: PollStats.custom HashMap replaced by a flat Vec table
//   5: MachineDescriptor header (machine-shape guard rail)
//   6: Memory gained the A1000 WCS (wcs + wcs_write_protected)
//   7: Bus.a2091 Option replaced by Bus.devices Vec<BoardDevice>; the
//      BoardBacking::A2091 variant became BoardBacking::Device(slot)
//   8: BoardDevice gained Wasm and A2065 variants (enum layout change)
//   9: CpuCore.fpr retyped f64 -> FloatX80 (80-bit extended FPU registers)
//  10: CpuCache backing arrays became Vec (variable line count for the
//      68040's 4 KB caches vs the 020/030's 256 bytes)
//  11: CpuCore MMU registers collapsed (removed tc/urp/srp/mmusr duplicates;
//      mmu_sr retyped u16->u32) so the 040 MOVEC path and the page-table
//      walker share one register set
//  12: Paula audio channels gained deferred AUDxEN-disable state so a DMA
//      clear is observed at the current word boundary
//  13: 68060 support - CpuType::M68060 appended; CpuCore gained pcr, buscr,
//      emulate_unimplemented_060, and the Oep060Timing pairing/branch-cache
//      state; MmuFault gained a cause (transient, but part of CpuCore's
//      serde shape indirectly via new fields)
//  14: 68030 resumable bus-fault frames - CpuCore gained mmu_read_override
//      and mmu_write_suppress (the RTE DF-cleared completion protocol,
//      pending across one instruction boundary) and pending_fault_wdata
//      (the frame's data output buffer)
//  15: Bus gained the bitplane DDF sequencer flop state (ddf_seq_line_initial,
//      ddf_seq_line_start_regs, ddf_seq_writes) - the per-line flop walk that
//      replaces the value-range DDF window for FMODE=0 fetches
//  16: CapturedBitplaneRow gained fetch_origin_cck (the sequencer run origin
//      for rows whose fetch diverges from the register-derived window)
//  17: DisplaySpriteDmaState gained the two-slot sprite fetch fields
//      (data_words_fetched pointer progression, pending_data)
//  21: CpuCore gained the 68010 loop-mode state (loop_mode,
//      loop_body_word, loop_dbcc_word)
//  22: Paula AudChannel replaced by the HRM state-machine shape (state,
//      buffer/auddat holding registers, percnt, request latches)
//  23: FloppyDrive gained the step-pulse timestamps (last_step_cck and the
//      per-direction stamps for the mechanism's 40 us pulse floor)
//  24: Cia gained the delayed /IRQ pin state (irq_pin,
//      irq_pin_delay_eticks - the 8520 one-E-cycle interrupt delay)
//  25: Blitter gained the early-dropping DMACONR BBUSY flag (bbusy) and
//      Bus the one-cck INTREQ.BLIT raise delay (blit_irq_delay_cck)
//  26: Copper gained the deferred SKIP decision (skip_eval - the condition
//      sampled at the next instruction's first-word fetch) and the COPJMP
//      strobe tail state (CopperState::Jumping, COP_JMP1/COP_JMP2)
//  27: LineBlitState gained the USEB line-program state (use_a/use_b flags,
//      the live B pointer bpt) and LineBlitPhase the two extra USEB pixel
//      cycles (LB fetch, LBus bare bus cycle)
//  28: Denise and RenderRegisterSnapshot gained the hardware-true sprite
//      latch view (spr_hw_pos/ctl/data/datb/armed - CPU/Copper writes AND
//      sprite DMA fetches, last writer wins; the existing spr* fields
//      remain the CPU/Copper write shadow the render replay is calibrated
//      against)
//  29: Msm6242Rtc gained the deterministic clock seed (seed_unix, frozen -
//      [machine] rtc_time / rtc_frozen), so a resumed run keeps reading
//      the same guest-visible time
//  30: Paula gained per-channel POT scan/discharge state and InputState gained
//      analogue paddle resistances for the RC-based POTxDAT converter
//  31: InputState reshaped into per-port ControllerPort device state (device
//      kind, JOYxDAT counters, button/direction/pot lines, CD32 serial
//      shifter); the Bus cd32_pad_shifter/cd32_pad_fire_oldstate fields
//      moved into the port
//  32: SCSI target slots (Wd33c93, A4091) hold a ScsiTarget enum (disk or
//      CD-ROM drive) instead of a bare ScsiDisk; the CD-ROM drive carries
//      CD-DA playback state and the tray countdown of a pending disc swap
//  33: A2065 gained the latched init-block MODE word (DTX/DRX/LOOP gating
//      of the LANCE engines) and NetConfig the Nat variant (userspace NAT
//      backend)
//  34: the Z3660 RTG board was appended to the BoardDevice enum; a state
//      holding one cannot be read by a build without the variant, so the
//      shape change bumps the version
//  35: Memory gained the Ramsey-controlled motherboard fast RAM bank
//      (mb_ram, ending at $08000000) and MachineDescriptor its size
//      (mb_ram_bytes)
//  36: Memory gained the CPU-slot accelerator fast RAM bank (accel_ram,
//      starting at $08000000) and MachineDescriptor its size
//      (accel_ram_bytes)
//  37: the Bus rtc field became the Rtc chip enum - MSM6242 or the
//      A3000/A4000's RP5C01 ([machine] rtc_chip), the Ricoh part carrying
//      its mode/alarm/battery-RAM state and both sharing the seeded
//      ClockSource
//  38: DriveSounds voices reshaped for the measured clack model (thump/
//      body/ring/tick components, pending rebound clatter, step spacing
//      counter) and the rev-locked motor (hum partial phases, revolution
//      phase, cascaded rumble poles, per-drive pattern seed); the
//      read-gated hiss voice was removed outright
//  39: Rp5c01Rtc gained the battmem backing-file binding (battmem_path,
//      battmem_dirty - [machine] battmem), so a resumed run keeps
//      persisting battery RAM to the same file
//  40: the WASM plugin host moved from wasmtime 27 to the 36 LTS. A board
//      snapshot stores a linear-memory image replayed against a module
//      recompiled at load time, so the serialized shape is unchanged and
//      an older state would still deserialize - and then run against
//      different codegen. Bump so it is refused rather than resumed into
//      a silent divergence (see the wasmtime pin in Cargo.toml)
//  41: Paula records the guest /LED bit (led_filter_guest_on) apart from the
//      effective filter state, for the [audio] audio_filter override; the
//      override mode itself is a host preference and is not serialized
//  42: NetConfig gained the Bridge variant and its host interface identifier
//  43: Zorro BoardSpec gained explicit memory-space, chained-configuration,
//      and tagged device-window fields; BoardDevice gained Picasso2 and its
//      complete CL-GD5426/VRAM state
//  44: Picasso2 and its Cirrus core gained the II+ revision identity and
//      serializable vertical-blank interrupt latch
//  45: Bus gained the 020+ posted-write debt, chip-port turnaround and
//      read-return carry
//  46: the 020+ read-return carry became the shared CPU/chip-bus clock phase
//      (Bus::cpu_chip_clock_phase). The layout is unchanged, but the field
//      now feeds chip-access synchronisation, so a state written before the
//      change would resume with a stale phase
//  47: CdImage's serde shadow became a backend enum (plain image files vs
//      CHD) to carry the new CHD CD image support
//  48: WasmCaps gained the resolve capability (host-OS-resolver lookups for
//      plugin boards -- the bundled HostSocket board's default resolver),
//      changing the bincode layout of every serialized WASM board's
//      manifest (same class of change as 42's NetConfig::Bridge)
//  49: HardDriveImage records a real host disk as one, rather than as a file
//      at the device's path. Loading a 48 state that had one would reopen
//      the raw node as an ordinary file -- read-write whatever it was
//      attached as, and past the checks that refuse the host's own disk
//  50: HostDiskState gained a stable hardware fingerprint and defers raw-media
//      acquisition until the complete state has decoded. Wasmtime also moved
//      from 36.0.12 to the security-fixed 36.0.13; plugin snapshots replay
//      through that runtime, so states from the older codegen are refused.
//  51: Bus gained the cold-power-on RAM initialisation policy, so a state
//      restored and later power-cycled repeats its zero or seeded pseudo-random
//      pattern.
//  52: WasmBoardState gained the faulted flag, preserving permanent plugin
//      fault isolation across save-state restoration.
//  53: BoardDevice gained the IdeZorro variant (the lide.device-compatible
//      Zorro II IDE board, `[lide]`), appended at the end of the enum.
//  54: AtaBus's cylinder registers became per-device-slot pairs, so each
//      slot keeps its own post-reset signature instead of device-select
//      rewriting a shared pair.
//  55: BoardDevice gained the GraffityZ2 and GraffityZ3 variants (the Atéo
//      Concepts Graffity RTG boards, `[rtg] card`), appended at the end of
//      the enum.
//  56: BoardDevice gained the Toccata variant (the MacroSystem Toccata
//      AD1848 sound board, `[toccata]`), appended at the end of the enum.
//  57: Paula gained the MHI-board audio ring (mhi_audio, `MhiAudioRing`) and
//      BoardDevice gained the Mhi variant (the virtual MPEG audio decoder
//      board, `[mhi]`, feature-gated behind `mhi`), appended at the end of
//      the enum.
//  58: The MHI board's decoder snapshot changed shape: the minimp3
//      field-for-field `mp3dec_t` shadow became a Symphonia warmup history
//      (the raw bytes of the most recently decoded frames, re-decoded on
//      restore) when the decoder moved to pure Rust for MSVC ARM64 hosts
//      (issue #474).
//  59: Mhi gained the M4 bass/mid/treble filter bank (tone_filters,
//      `ToneFilterBank`) -- the param-latch DSP chain's genuine machine
//      state (biquad coefficients and filter memory), `[mhi]`, feature-
//      gated behind `mhi`.
//  60: Akiko's `command_active` widened from u8 to u32: it now counts the
//      drive microcontroller's command turnaround in emulated CCKs
//      (CMD_EXEC_DELAY_CCK) instead of counting register accesses.
//  61: PortDevice gained the GamepadMouse variant (a mouse a gamepad can
//      move as well as the host's own, `[input] port1`), appended at the
//      end of the enum.
//  62: CdImage's cue-sheet shadow records each FILE's format and sector
//      byte length (WAVE/MP3 audio tracks, reopened and re-indexed on
//      load) and its extents gained a storage tag (file bytes or an
//      unstored PREGAP/POSTGAP).
//  63: DiskDma gained `write_start_pending`, so a write armed against an
//      idle floppy mechanism re-latches its rotational start when cells
//      first arrive.
//  64: the bundled HostSocket WASM module moved from smoltcp 0.13 to 0.14.
//      Its TCP/IP stack lives as Rust values in the plugin's snapshotted
//      linear memory, whose internal layout is replayed against the current
//      module on load; reject old snapshots rather than interpret that memory
//      with the new dependency's layout.
