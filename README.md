Copperline is a cycle-driven Commodore Amiga emulator (OCS, ECS, and AGA) written in Rust. It models the Amiga custom chipset, 680x0 CPU, memory subsystems, and common expansion hardware on a unified clock timeline.

It boots out of the box with the bundled open-source AROS Kickstart replacement, and supports official Kickstart ROMs (1.3 through 3.1), DiagROM, and standard disk, hardfile, and CD media.

## Features

- **Chipset and machine models**: OCS, ECS, and AGA support with profiles from the A500 through the A4000, plus CDTV and CD32.
- **Configurable CPU and memory**: Motorola 68000 through 68060, optional FPU and MMU support, and configurable Chip, Fast, and Slow RAM.
- **Storage and media**: Floppy disk images (ADF, ADZ, DMS, IPF, SCP), physical floppy drives via Greaseweazle (FluxBridge), IDE (Gayle/A4000 and expansion boards), SCSI (A2091, A3000, A4091), virtual hard disks (`copperhf.device`), CD-ROM, and host directory mounts.
- **Audio and video**: 4-channel Paula audio, RTG graphics cards (Picasso II/II+, Z3660), host MIDI in/out bridging, and built-in Roland MT-32 and General MIDI synthesis.
- **Expansion and networking**: Zorro II/III autoconfig, A2065 Ethernet, host-backed bsdsocket.library, and sandboxed WebAssembly expansion plugins.
- **Debugging**: CPU and chipset debugger, reverse stepping, live Kickstart/AROS symbols, frame and instruction profiling, VCD waveforms, and source debugging through GDB or DAP. Both the native VS Code extension and the [Copperline fork of Bartman's extension](docs/debugger/vscode-bartman.md) are supported.
- **Automation and replay**: [Save states](docs/guide/ui.md#save-states), [WinUAE state import](docs/guide/winuae-state.md), headless input scripts and captures, and a JSON-RPC control protocol. `copperline-ctl` also provides DAP (`--dap`) and MCP (`--mcp`) servers.
- **Freezer cartridge**: Action Replay-style cartridge support with bundled HRTMon (`--cartridge hrtmon`), allowing running software to be frozen into the monitor via the menu, a hotkey, headless `--freeze-after`, or the control protocol.
- **Direct launching**: Boot directly into WHDLoad game packages (`--whdload`) or host-built Amiga executables (`--run`, including bare Kickstart 1.3), with a WinUAE-compatible `uaelib` trap allowing guest code to control warp speed, log debug messages, and register debug resources.
- **WebAssembly build**: Run directly in modern web browsers at [copperline.dev/try](https://copperline.dev/try/).
- **Libretro core**: [Run Amiga and CD32 software in RetroArch](docs/guide/libretro.md), with embedded AROS ROMs, WHDLoad, disk playlists, save states and RetroArch rollback netplay.

## Installation

### macOS (Homebrew)

```sh
brew tap copperlinehq/copperline https://github.com/CopperlineHQ/Copperline
brew install copperline
```

To build from the latest development commit instead:

```sh
brew install --HEAD copperline
```

Pre-built disk images (`.dmg`) are also available on the [releases page](https://github.com/CopperlineHQ/Copperline/releases).

### Linux (Flatpak or AppImage)

```sh
flatpak install flathub dev.copperline.Copperline
flatpak run dev.copperline.Copperline
```

Standalone AppImage binaries are also available on the [releases page](https://github.com/CopperlineHQ/Copperline/releases).

*Note:* On Linux, presentation requires a Vulkan driver. Most modern GPUs support Vulkan natively. For virtual machines or older hardware, install the Mesa software Vulkan driver (`mesa-vulkan-drivers` on Debian/Ubuntu/Fedora, or `vulkan-swrast` on Arch). The Flatpak package bundles software Vulkan automatically.

### Building from source

```sh
cargo build --release
```

Run the resulting `target/release/copperline` binary. `--release` is a Cargo
build option; unoptimized debug builds are too slow for real-time emulation.

The [Debug workspace](docs/debugger/window.md) puts the Amiga display beside
its debugger, Frame Analyzer, and Console in one desktop window. Open
**Debugger...** in the menu or press
`Cmd+B` on macOS or `Alt+B` on Linux/Windows. Drag the display divider to resize
the panes; **Return to Play** restores the display layout while keeping the
inspectors and their state. Click the display to send input to the Amiga, and
use `Cmd+G` / `Alt+G` to return input to the debugger. Monospace readouts use
Hack with a slashed zero. Audio scopes stay beside fixed-height channel
details as DMA and interrupt events change.

Dependencies:

- Rust 1.95+ (tested on stable)
- Windows ARM64 source builds: LLVM clang on `PATH` for Internet netplay's crypto backend. The Windows packaging script also finds Visual Studio's bundled Clang tools.
- Fedora build dependencies: `sudo dnf install alsa-lib-devel systemd-devel gcc`
- Debian/Ubuntu build dependencies: `sudo apt install libasound2-dev libsystemd-dev gcc`

## Quick Start

Run Copperline from the terminal:

```sh
./target/release/copperline
```

Running with no arguments and no `./copperline.toml` opens the interactive configuration launcher (defaulting to an A500 profile with the bundled AROS ROM).

To boot directly into a Kickstart ROM, configuration file, or floppy image:

```sh
./target/release/copperline path/to/kickstart.rom
./target/release/copperline --config path/to/copperline.toml
./target/release/copperline --model A1200 --fast 8M KICK31.ROM --insert-disk-after 0 df0 game.adf
```

### Essential keyboard shortcuts

- **Quit**: `Cmd+Q` (macOS) / `Alt+Q` (Linux/Windows)
- **Debugger**: `Cmd+B` (macOS) / `Alt+B` (Linux/Windows)
- **Screenshot**: `Cmd+S` (macOS) / `Alt+S` (Linux/Windows)
- **Mouse capture**: `Cmd+G` (macOS) / `Alt+G` (Linux/Windows)
- **Joystick toggle**: `Cmd+J` (macOS) / `Alt+J` (Linux/Windows) switches between physical gamepad and keyboard arrows.

See the [UI guide](docs/guide/ui.md) for full interface details.

## Configuration

Copperline uses TOML configuration files. You can copy `copperline.example.toml` to `copperline.toml` to customize machine settings:

```toml
rom = "kickstart31.rom"

[cpu]
model = "68020"

[memory]
chip = "2M"
fast = "8M"

[chipset]
revision = "AGA"
video = "PAL"

[floppy.df0]
path = "game.adf"
```

See the [configuration guide](docs/guide/configuration.md) for the complete reference of all configuration options, machine profiles, and storage settings.

## Documentation

The manual is published at [copperline.dev/docs](https://copperline.dev/docs/) and available under `docs/`:

- [Getting Started](docs/guide/getting-started.md) - Installation and setup
- [Configuration](docs/guide/configuration.md) - Configuration file reference and CLI options
- [User Interface](docs/guide/ui.md) - Windows, menus, and controls
- [WHDLoad Support](docs/guide/whdload.md) - Direct WHDLoad package loading
- [Direct Executable Launching](docs/guide/run.md) - Running cross-compiled Amiga binaries
- [Floppy Hardware Bridge](docs/guide/fluxbridge.md) - Real floppy drives via Greaseweazle
- [Rollback Netplay](docs/guide/netplay.md) - two-player sessions with mice, joysticks or CD32 pads through desktop GUI/CLI (direct IP or encrypted Internet invitations with automatic NAT traversal and relay fallback), or browser WebRTC with QR invitations. Both frontends transfer the host's ROMs, disks and machine settings and synchronize host floppy swaps. Up to eight spectators can watch through a separate invitation, joining even mid-game by replaying the host's confirmed history. Desktop also shares WHDLoad, `--run`, and IDE/SCSI/LIDE game volumes using temporary session storage, and preserves IPF protection-track timing during disk transfer. Mouse movement is combined per frame, and desktop corrections finish rendering so continuous movement keeps reaching the display. Detailed desktop transport logs are opt-in with `COPPERLINE_NETPLAY_DEBUG=1`.
