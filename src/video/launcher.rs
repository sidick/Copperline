//! The pre-boot machine-configuration screen's data model.
//!
//! When Copperline is started with no config (and from the "Machine
//! Configuration..." menu item) a launcher panel lets the user pick a machine
//! and configure everything about it before pressing Run. This module holds the
//! editable model behind that panel; the panel's pixel layout and hit-testing
//! live in [`crate::video::ui`], and the App integration (file dialogs, Run,
//! Save) lives in [`crate::video::window`].
//!
//! [`MachineSetup`] is a fully-typed editable mirror of the configurable
//! machine. It is built from, and converted back to, the loadable
//! [`RawConfig`]: loading parses a file into a `RawConfig`, validates it through
//! the existing `TryFrom<RawConfig> for Config` pipeline, then fills the typed
//! fields; Run and Save go the other way via [`MachineSetup::to_raw`], so the
//! configuration screen reuses all of the config layer's validation and
//! profile-default logic instead of duplicating it. `to_raw` emits only the
//! fields that differ from the selected profile's defaults, so a saved file
//! reads like the hand-written `*.example.toml`.
