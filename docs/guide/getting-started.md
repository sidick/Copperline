# Getting started

Copperline can be run as a native desktop application or in the browser
at [copperline.dev/try](https://copperline.dev/try/). This chapter covers
system requirements, installation, building from source, and initial setup.

## System requirements

- **Rust (source builds only):** 1.95 or newer; CI uses the stable toolchain.
- **Supported operating systems:** macOS 14.2 (Sonoma) or newer, Linux, and
  Windows. The macOS floor applies to source builds as well as the pre-built
  application: the audio backend uses Core Audio APIs introduced in 14.2.
- **Graphics backend:** Metal on macOS, Direct3D 12 or Vulkan on Windows, and
  Vulkan on Linux (see [](#vulkan-is-required-on-linux)).
- **Linux build dependencies:** `sudo dnf install alsa-lib-devel systemd-devel gcc`
  on Fedora, or `sudo apt install libasound2-dev libudev-dev pkg-config gcc` on
  Debian/Ubuntu.
- **Boot ROM:** Copperline includes the open-source [AROS](http://www.aros.org/)
  Kickstart replacement and boots it by default. It also runs real Kickstart
  ROMs (1.x through 3.2, plus the CDTV and CD32 extended ROMs) and
  [DiagROM](https://www.diagrom.com/). Use a single-file 512 KiB image or
  a 256 KiB Kickstart 1.x image; Copperline mirrors the latter across its
  512 KiB ROM window. See [ROM formats](configuration.md#top-level).

## Installing on macOS (Homebrew)

The repository doubles as a Homebrew tap:

```sh
brew tap copperlinehq/copperline https://github.com/CopperlineHQ/Copperline
brew install copperline
```

To build directly from the latest development commit:

```sh
brew install --HEAD copperline
```

Pre-built macOS application bundles (`Copperline-X.Y.Z-macos-universal.dmg`) are
also available on the [releases page](https://github.com/CopperlineHQ/Copperline/releases).
Mount the disk image and copy `Copperline.app` to `/Applications`. If macOS
quarantine blocks the first launch, right-click the app and choose **Open**, or run:

```sh
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Copperline.app
```

## Installing on Linux

### AppImage

Standalone AppImage binaries are provided on the
[releases page](https://github.com/CopperlineHQ/Copperline/releases):

```sh
chmod +x Copperline-*.AppImage
./Copperline-*.AppImage
```

(linux-flatpak)=
### Flatpak (build it yourself)

Copperline is not published on Flathub, and releases do not include a
Flatpak bundle. The repository's `packaging/flatpak/` directory holds the
Flatpak manifest, which you can build into a sandboxed package that brings its
own runtime dependencies and works across distributions.

The build needs `flatpak`, `curl`, and `python3` with its `venv` module. From
the top of a clean checkout (check out a release tag for a released version),
run:

```sh
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists --user flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
flatpak install --user flathub org.flatpak.Builder
./packaging/flatpak/generate-cargo-sources.sh
flatpak run org.flatpak.Builder --force-clean --user --install \
    --install-deps-from=flathub --repo=repo builddir \
    packaging/flatpak/dev.copperline.Copperline.yaml
flatpak run dev.copperline.Copperline
```

The script writes the crate list that lets the build run offline, and
`--install-deps-from=flathub` fetches the Freedesktop runtime, SDK and Rust
extension the manifest names. The manifest copies the whole checkout into the
build, including any stray ROM or disk images in the repository root, which is
why a clean checkout matters.
[`packaging/flatpak/README.md`](https://github.com/CopperlineHQ/Copperline/blob/main/packaging/flatpak/README.md)
covers linting and the host-side helper for bridged Ethernet.

(vulkan-is-required-on-linux)=
### Vulkan is required on Linux

On Linux, presentation uses the Vulkan backend via `wgpu`. If no Vulkan adapter
is found, the application exits at launch.

Modern GPUs generally provide hardware Vulkan support through Mesa drivers.
For virtual machines or older hardware, install the software Vulkan driver (lavapipe):

- **Arch Linux:** `sudo pacman -S vulkan-swrast`
- **Debian / Ubuntu:** `sudo apt install mesa-vulkan-drivers`
- **Fedora:** `sudo dnf install mesa-vulkan-drivers`

A [self-built Flatpak](#linux-flatpak) needs no host package: its Freedesktop
runtime supplies Mesa, including lavapipe.

## Installing on Windows

Download `Copperline-X.Y.Z-win-x64.zip` or `Copperline-X.Y.Z-win-arm64.zip`
from the [releases page](https://github.com/CopperlineHQ/Copperline/releases),
matching your Windows architecture. Extract the whole archive and run
`copperline.exe`; keep the bundled ROMs and other assets alongside it.

### The console window

`copperline.exe` is a console program. Run from a command prompt, it behaves
like any other command-line tool: the shell waits for it, and `--help`, the
log and the output of every [headless flag](headless.md) go to that terminal.

Started from Explorer or the Start menu, it has no prompt to write to, so
Copperline closes the console window Windows opens for it and leaves only the
emulator window. The console may still flash briefly, because Windows shows it
before Copperline starts running.

(command-line-tools)=
## Command-line tools

Every package also carries two companion programs: `copperline-ctl`, the
[control protocol](../debugger/control.md) client whose `--mcp` and `--dap`
modes serve coding agents and the [VS Code extension](../debugger/vscode.md),
and `copperline-import-uae`, the [WinUAE/Amiberry/FS-UAE config
converter](import-uae.md). Where they land depends on the package:

| Package | Location |
|---|---|
| Homebrew | On PATH, next to `copperline`. |
| macOS dmg | Inside the bundle, `Copperline.app/Contents/MacOS/`. Add that directory to PATH or name the files in the VS Code settings. |
| Windows zip | Next to `copperline.exe` in the extracted folder. Add the folder to PATH or name the `.exe` files in the VS Code settings. |
| AppImage | The separate `Copperline-X.Y.Z-<arch>-tools.tar.gz` release asset. Unpack it anywhere; set `COPPERLINE_BIN` to the AppImage path so `copperline-ctl` can launch the emulator. |
| [Self-built Flatpak](#linux-flatpak) | In the sandbox: `flatpak run --command=copperline-ctl dev.copperline.Copperline ...` (and likewise `copperline-import-uae`). |

`copperline-ctl` launches the `copperline` beside it when one is there; the
[DAP chapter](../debugger/dap.md) lists the full lookup order.

## Building from source

```sh
cargo build --release
```

```{warning}
Use the binary in `target/release/` for emulation. `--release` is a Cargo
build option, not a Copperline command-line flag. Unoptimized debug builds
are too slow for real-time emulation.
```

(cargo-features)=
### Cargo features

A default build includes everything below except the last three features.
To leave something out, build with `--no-default-features` and list the
features to keep; the [FluxBridge](fluxbridge.md), [MT-32](mt32.md), and
[Coppersynth](coppersynth.md) chapters show complete examples.

| Feature | Default | What it adds |
|---|---|---|
| `frontend` | yes | The desktop window, launcher, inspectors, host audio, gamepads, and file dialogs. The `copperline` binary requires it. |
| `midi` | yes | Host MIDI for `[serial] mode = "midi"` (CoreMIDI, the ALSA sequencer, or WinMM). |
| `mt32` | yes | The built-in [MT-32](mt32.md). |
| `coppersynth` | yes | The built-in [Coppersynth](coppersynth.md) General MIDI synthesizer. |
| `host-serial` | yes | A real host serial port on Paula's UART (`[serial] mode = "device"`). |
| `fluxbridge` | yes | [Physical floppy drives](fluxbridge.md) through a Greaseweazle. |
| `net-nat` | yes | User-mode NAT networking for the emulated network boards. |
| `net-bridge` | yes | Bridged networking to a host Ethernet adapter, and the `copperline-net-helper` binary. |
| `netplay-internet` | yes | Internet [netplay](netplay.md) with NAT traversal and relay fallback. |
| `wasm-boards` | yes | WebAssembly [Zorro board plugins](../zorro.md). |
| `cpu-jit` | yes | Native code generation for `[cpu] jit`. |
| `control` | yes | The [control protocol](../debugger/control.md) server (`--control`, `--control-gui`). |
| `ctl-bin` | yes | The `copperline-ctl` binary, with its MCP and DAP modes. |
| `gdb` | yes | The [GDB remote stub](../debugger/gdb.md). |
| `dap` | yes | The [Debug Adapter Protocol](../debugger/dap.md) adapter and the guest debug-information reader. |
| `import-uae-bin` | yes | The [`copperline-import-uae`](import-uae.md) converter. |
| `game-library` | yes | The launcher's [WHDLoad](whdload.md) Library page and its OpenRetro sync. |
| `update-check` | yes | The About panel's [Check for updates](ui.md#and-last) button, which asks GitHub for the latest release only when pressed. |
| `mhi` | yes | The MHI MPEG audio decoder board. |
| `cd-mp3` | yes | MP3 audio tracks in CD cue sheets. |
| `cd32-fmv` | yes | The CD32 Full Motion Video module. |
| `profile-stats` | yes | Detailed host-cost counters for native diagnostics. |
| `bench-bin` | no | The headless `copperline-bench` benchmark binary (see [](browser.md)). |
| `display-plan-trace` | no | Display-plan tracing (`COPPERLINE_TRACE_DISPLAY_PLAN`) in release builds; debug and test builds always have it. |
| `internal-diagnostics` | no | Environment overrides that deliberately change timing (`COPPERLINE_NO_BUS_ARB` and similar), for local investigation only. |

### Tests

To run the test suite:

```sh
cargo test                          # Unit tests (no external assets required)
cargo test --release -- --ignored   # Integration tests (requires local test media)
```

The ignored integration tests in `tests/` need Kickstart ROMs and disk images
that are not part of the repository. They look for them in the directory
named by `COPPERLINE_TEST_ASSETS`, then in `test-assets/` at the repository
root, and pass without running when their assets are absent.
[`tests/README.md`](https://github.com/CopperlineHQ/Copperline/blob/main/tests/README.md)
lists what each test needs.

For the optimized native CI suite, including the deterministic golden renders,
use `cargo test --profile ci --locked`. The `ci` profile inherits release
settings but disables LTO and uses parallel code generation to compile test
executables faster. Its binaries are in `target/ci/`; normal builds and
performance benchmarks continue to use `--release`. Add `--timings` to write
a build report to `target/cargo-timings/cargo-timing.html`.

The golden renders live in `timing-test/golden/`. A hardware-model change
that alters them on purpose is re-blessed with
`COPPERLINE_BLESS_GOLDEN=1 cargo test --release --test probe_golden`, and the
render differences are reviewed as part of the change.

## First boot

Run Copperline from the terminal:

```sh
./target/release/copperline
```

When started with no arguments and no `copperline.toml` in the current directory,
Copperline displays the interactive launcher screen where you can configure
machine models, memory, storage, and peripherals. Any machine, media, or
headless option skips the launcher; `--factory` on its own does not.

With no saved default, the launcher starts with an Amiga 500 (Rev 6A): ECS
8372A Agnus, OCS 8362 Denise, 512 KiB chip RAM, 512 KiB slow RAM, and the
bundled AROS Kickstart replacement. **Save default** writes your settings to
`default.toml` in the configurations folder (see
[Where files go](ui.md#where-files-go)) and every later run that names no
configuration loads it. If that saved default has **Run on startup** set
(`[emulation] auto_launch`), the launcher starts the machine straight away.
`--factory` ignores the saved default, and also leaves Coppersynth's and the
modem's stored settings untouched; an explicit `--config` or a local
`copperline.toml` still takes precedence.

To boot directly into a specific Kickstart ROM or configuration file:

```sh
./target/release/copperline path/to/kickstart.rom
./target/release/copperline --config path/to/copperline.toml
```

You can also specify machine parameters via command-line flags:

```sh
./target/release/copperline --model A1200 --fast 8M KICK31.ROM
```

See [](configuration#command-line-overrides) for the full list of CLI flags.

```{figure} ../images/kick13-insert-disk.png
:alt: Kickstart 1.3 insert-disk screen
:width: 75%

Kickstart 1.3 waiting for a boot floppy.
```

To mount a floppy disk image on boot:

```toml
rom = "KICK13.ROM"

[floppy.df0]
path = "Game.adf"
```

Supported floppy formats include ADF, ADZ (gzip-compressed ADF), single-file ZIP,
DMS, extended ADF, IPF, and SCP. In interactive sessions, disk images can also
be inserted via drag-and-drop into the emulator window.

## Example configuration

A fully commented example configuration is available in `copperline.example.toml`
in the root of the repository. Copy it to `copperline.toml` or pass it via `--config`:

```sh
./target/release/copperline --config copperline.example.toml
```

## Logging and crash reports

The log goes to stderr at the `info` level. Set `RUST_LOG=debug` or
`RUST_LOG=trace` in the environment for more detail.

If Copperline panics, it writes the panic message and a backtrace to
`copperline-crash.txt`: next to the executable when that folder is writable,
otherwise in the current working directory, and failing that in the system
temporary directory. The path it chose is printed to stderr. Please include
this file when reporting bugs.
