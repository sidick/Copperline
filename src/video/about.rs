//! The About panel: what it says, and how it makes its entrance.
//!
//! Everything plays off one clock -- milliseconds since the panel
//! opened -- so the entrance is a pure function of time and draws
//! nothing, allocates nothing and runs nothing while the panel is
//! closed.
//!
//! Everything editable sits at the top of the file: the names in
//! [`CONTRIBUTORS`] and [`PATREON_SPONSORS`] (add a name, the page
//! re-times and re-wraps itself), the pacing constants, and the wave
//! sheets in [`LAYERS`]. Nothing below them needs touching for a
//! content change.
//!
//! Builds with the update check add a footer under the water: its
//! button and the line beside it are panel chrome, drawn and hit-tested
//! by `ui.rs` like every other panel's buttons, from an [`UpdateFooter`]
//! the window fills in.
