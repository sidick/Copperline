//! Deterministic input replay for reverse debugging.
//!
//! Byte-identical reverse replay requires every machine-visible input to be
//! reproduced at exactly the instruction position it was first applied. The
//! live forward run (window.rs) keeps firing scripted and interactive input
//! exactly as it always has; when reverse mode is armed it additionally
//! *notes* each applied action into a [`ReplayInputLog`] keyed by retired
//! instruction position. When a reverse op restores an earlier snapshot and
//! replays forward, the engine re-applies the logged actions as it reaches
//! their positions, so the reconstructed timeline matches the original.
//!
//! Input is recorded at the central bus-affecting helpers (keyboard, mouse
//! buttons, mouse motion, scripted joystick), through which both scripted
//! (`--script` / `--press-after` / ...) and the live window paths funnel, so
//! there is a single record site per kind and no double counting.
