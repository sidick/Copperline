# Peripherals and expansion

## Zorro autoconfig (`zorro.rs`)

The `ZorroChain` implements the Zorro II/III autoconfig protocol --
nibble-encoded config ROMs in the `$E80000` window, base-address
assignment, shut-up, chain advance, and power-on reset. Boards are
described by data (`BoardSpec`) rather than a trait; the built-in fast and
Z3 RAM options and user `[[zorro]]` metadata boards all build the same
specs. The user-facing guide, including the metadata file format and the
autoconfig walk-through, is [](../zorro).

## Fat Gary and Ramsey (`gary.rs`, `ramsey.rs`)

The A3000 and A4000 profiles fit the big-box motherboard pair: Fat Gary,
the bus controller, and Ramsey, the memory controller. Both answer in the
`$DE0000` page Gary decodes, with an address decode cruder than a register
map suggests: only the byte lane and two address bits matter (lanes 0-2
are Gary's, lane 3 is Ramsey's), and the whole layout repeats every `$100`
to the end of the page, so every register is mirrored many times over --
the Ramsey version register Kickstart reads at `$DE0043` answers equally
at `$DE0047` or `$DE0143`. Diagnostic tools reading addresses that look
like nothing in particular are reading a mirror.

Gary's three registers are single read/write bits in bit 7: TIMEOUT
(`$DE0000`, whether an unanswered bus cycle produces BERR or DSACK), TOENB
(`$DE0001`, timeout enable), and COLDBOOT (`$DE0002`, the power-up flag
the OS clears on warm reboot). None of them change emulated behaviour --
bus timeouts are not modelled; an unanswered cycle floats -- but the
read/write COLDBOOT bit is what identification tools use to detect a Fat
Gary, and without one they never go looking for the Ramsey behind it.

Ramsey drives the motherboard fast RAM (`[memory] motherboard`): a 32-bit
local bank ending at `$08000000` and growing downward, so a full 16 MiB
reaches `$07000000`. Its two byte-wide registers sit on lane 3: the
control register at `$DE0003` (refresh rate, page/burst/skip modes, DRAM
geometry) and the read-only version register at `$DE0043` -- `$0D` for
the A3000's Ramsey-04, `$0F` for the A4000's Ramsey-07, a distinction
that matters because the two parts disagree about control bit 4
(Ramsey-04 DRAM width versus Ramsey-07 cycle-skip mode). Refresh and the
speed modes have no observable effect in an emulator that never loses a
DRAM cell, but the bits store and read back because Kickstart and the
diagnostic tools write a mode and spin until they read it back, and the
geometry bits are seeded to describe DRAM parts matching the fitted RAM
size so sizing probes agree with the RAM that answers. Only the register
file lives in `ramsey.rs`; the RAM bank itself is `memory::Memory::mb_ram`.

Beyond Ramsey's four banks the big-box memory map reserves
`$04000000`-`$06FFFFFF` for motherboard RAM expansion; on the A4000
profile the bank keeps growing downward through it, up to 64 MiB at
`$04000000`, still sized by Kickstart's top-down probe (the control
register keeps describing the fully populated 1Mx4 geometry -- it has
no way to say more). The complementary `[memory] accelerator` bank
models CPU-slot local RAM: it starts at `$08000000` and grows upward
through the coprocessor-slot space, up to 128 MiB at `$10000000` where
Zorro III space begins, gated only on a 32-bit CPU
(`memory::Memory::accel_ram`).

## Gayle IDE (`gayle.rs`)

A600/A1200 machines get the Gayle gate array: the ID register at
`$DE1000`, the IDE task file at `$DA0000` (byte registers on the odd word
half, 4-byte stride), and the IDE interrupt and status bits. Drives are
raw flat HDF images with an RDB inside, opened read/write; PIO transfers
complete synchronously within the access. One hardware subtlety worth
knowing: Gayle byte-swaps the IDE bus, so IDENTIFY data words are
low-byte-first while sector data passes through untouched -- Kickstart
3.1 expects exactly this. The absent-slave behaviour follows the
WinUAE-verified model so device scans terminate correctly. PCMCIA reports
an empty slot (the status/config registers exist so card.resource
behaves); credit-card device emulation is a non-goal.

Either drive slot may instead be an ATAPI CD-ROM (a `.cue`/`.iso`/`.chd`
image): `ata.rs`'s task-file engine drives the PACKET (0xA0) command,
handing 12-byte CDBs to the same bus-agnostic SCSI-2 CD-ROM command engine
(`scsi/cd.rs`'s `ScsiCdRom`) the `[scsi]` host adapters use, so the read
family, TOC/sub-channel queries, mode pages, and CD-DA playback all behave
identically over ATAPI PACKET or a WD33C93 SCSI bus.

## A4000 motherboard IDE (`ide_a4000.rs`)

The A4000 profile decodes the same ATA task file (`ata.rs`) at `$DD2020`
with no gate array in front of it -- the layout Kickstart's own
`scsi.device` probes, with the Gayle-style 4-byte register stride, the
control block one A12 page up at `$DD3038`, and an interrupt status byte
at `$DD3020` whose bit 7 is the drive's INTRQ. Unlike Gayle there is no
interrupt-change latch: INTRQ feeds INT2 directly and the driver drops it
by reading the status register. Drives come from the same `[ide]`
section as Gayle machines, ATAPI CD-ROMs included -- same `ata.rs` engine,
same PACKET protocol.

## SCSI controllers (`a2091.rs`, `a4091.rs`, `sdmac.rs`, `scsi.rs`)

The `[scsi]` option attaches one of three host adapters, selected by its
`controller` key: the Zorro II A2091 (the default), the Zorro III A4091,
or the A3000's motherboard Super DMAC. All three drive the same SCSI-2
target layer in `scsi.rs`.

### A2091 (`a2091.rs`)

The A2091 is a Zorro II device board pairing the Commodore DMAC (rev 02
modeled) with a WD33C93A SBIC, plus the board's autoboot ROM whose
`scsi.device` drives them. The autoconfig
identity comes from the DMAC -- Commodore West Chester (514), product 3,
`ERTF_DIAGVALID` with `er_InitDiagVec` pointing at `$2000` -- while the
ROM supplies the DiagArea and the driver; the ROM image therefore is a
required configuration input (`rom`/`rom_odd`, split even/odd EPROM
dumps interleaved U13-first).

Board window layout: ISTR `$40`, CNTR `$42`, WTC `$80/$82`, ACR
`$84/$86` (low bit forced even), DAWR `$8E`, the WD33C93 SASR/auxiliary
status at `$90/$91` and data port at `$92/$93`, the ST_DMA/SP_DMA/CINT/
FLUSH strobes at `$E0/$E2/$E4/$E8` (read- or write-triggered), and the
boot ROM repeating from `$2000` to the end of the 64K window. Unpopulated
decode below the ROM reads as floating bus (`$FF`): the boot ROM's drive
probe ANDs the A590 XT-interface bytes at `$A1/$A3/$A5/$A7` and only
takes the SCSI-only path when they all read `$FF` -- zeros wedge it
polling a phantom XT drive.

The WD33C93A model covers both ways drivers run the bus, verified against
the real 7.0 boot ROM booting a Workbench install end-to-end:

- the **Select-and-Transfer** combination command (full transaction in
  one command, status byte landing in the Target LUN register, CSR
  `$16` then the `$85` disconnect interrupt), including the short-data
  pause (`$4B`, command phase `$46`) and resume that real targets force
  on MODE SENSE-style reads; and
- the **manual path** the 7.0 ROM uses: Select-with-ATN posting CSR
  `$11` then service-required `$88|phase`, identify message and CDB via
  Transfer Info (with the single-byte-transfer modifier), phase-qualified
  completions (`CSR_XFER_DONE | next phase`), message-in pausing with
  `$20` until Negate ACK releases the target to disconnect.

Data phases run through the DMAC handshake (a word per DMAC cycle into
chip, slow, or Zorro RAM with the 24-bit ACR auto-incrementing) or
through the PIO data register with DBR. Like the Gayle model, transfers
complete within the access; completion interrupts are delivered after a
short emulated delay, and INT2 is the level `CNTR_INTEN && ISTR &
(INTS|E_INT)` fed to Paula's PORTS latch each tick. DMAC bus-master
cycles are not yet arbitrated against the CPU (TODO in `a2091.rs`).

### A4091 (`a4091.rs`)

The A4091 is a Zorro III SCSI-2 controller carrying an NCR 53C710 and a
nibble-wide autoboot ROM. Within its 16M window, `$000000-$7FFFFF` is the
boot ROM presented nibble-wide (expansion.library reassembles the
DiagArea with DAC_NIBBLEWIDE, and the ROM's own relocator copies the
driver the same way), `$800000` is the 53C710 register file (only the low
6 address bits decode, so it mirrors across the window -- the driver
relies on the `+$40` shadow as a cache write-allocate workaround), and
`$8C0003` reads the DIP-switch byte (host ID, termination, negotiation
enables). A DSP write starts the 53C710's SCRIPTS processor, whose phase
engine executes the driver's SCRIPTS programs against the disk targets.
The autoconfig identity is Commodore product 84 with `er_InitDiagVec`
`$0200`.

### A3000 Super DMAC (`sdmac.rs`)

The SDMAC is the SCSI DMA controller on the A3000 motherboard, not a
Zorro board: a register file at `$DD0000` (repeating at `$DD0100` -- the
"ALT" shadow that write-through tools use to defeat CPU write buffering)
that owns the DMA FIFO and interrupt plumbing and maps a WD33C93's
register file into a select latch and data port. It is the same layering
as the A2091 -- two front-ends onto the one `Wd33c93` core -- differing in
the register map, the ISTR bits, and a 32-bit DMA address counter
(physically in Ramsey) instead of the Zorro II DMAC's 24-bit one.
Kickstart's built-in `scsi.device` drives the pair directly, so there is
no boot ROM to configure.

### Shared drive backend

All IDE and SCSI drives share the `harddrive.rs` sector backend: raw
HDF images, bare partition hardfiles wrapped in a synthesized RDB
(bootable `DHn` named after the unit), gzip-compressed hardfiles (`.hdz`,
sniffed by gzip magic and unpacked by `gzip.rs` into memory at open time
because deflate has no random access, which is what makes their writes
session-only), and host directories built into in-memory FFS or OFS volumes by
`dirfs.rs` (FFS by default; `filesystem = "ofs"` on the drive picks OFS,
the one every Kickstart from 1.2 onward can read with no guest-side
setup -- FFS needs a handler loaded from disk or an RDB `FileSystemHeader`
chain, neither of which Copperline bundles). The volume label defaults to
the directory name, or a `name` override configured on the drive. The
SCSI-2 target layer in
`scsi.rs` answers INQUIRY, MODE SENSE pages 3/4, READ CAPACITY,
READ/WRITE(6)/(10), REQUEST SENSE, and the no-op housekeeping commands,
with sense state kept per target.

The drive controllers latch read/write activity, which the bus drains to
light the status-bar HDD LED; the LED holds for a short minimum period so
brief accesses stay visible. Gayle, the A4000 IDE, the A2091, the SDMAC,
and the lide-compatible board (below) report activity today; the A4091
shows the LED but does not latch activity into it yet.

## lide.device-compatible Zorro II IDE (`ide_zorro.rs`)

`[lide]` attaches a Zorro II IDE board compatible with LIV2's
actively-maintained open-source `lide.device`, in three AutoConfig
personalities selected by `board`: **RIPPLE** (mfg `0x144A`/product 7, two
ATA channels), **RIDE** (mfg `0x144A`/product 9, one channel, sharing
RIPPLE's ROM image and register layout), and **AT-Bus 2008** (mfg
`0x082C`/product 6, one channel, the register model shared by that board's
whole clone family). All three reuse the front-end-agnostic ATA core in
`ata.rs` (the same one Gayle and the A4000 IDE port use) and the shared
drive backend above; the new work is entirely in the board's own address
decode, since none of the three personalities resemble Gayle's 4-byte task
file. Drive slots may be ATA hard disks or, since `ata.rs` gained ATAPI
PACKET support, `.cue`/`.iso`/`.chd` CD-ROM images.

**Register decode.** Each ATA channel occupies a 4K block of the board
window, with register index `(offset >> 9) & 7` -- ATA A0-A2 are wired to
CPU A9-A11, so a register answers throughout its 512-byte slot, which is
what lets the driver bulk-transfer a sector with `movem.l`. Every register
but the 16-bit data port sits on the *upper* byte lane (even addresses,
D15-D8); the odd lane floats. RIPPLE's two channels sit at window offset
`$1000`/control `$5000` (channel 0) and `$2000`/`$6000` (channel 1) -- two
chip selects per physical connector, task file and control block, per the
RTL's own decode; RIDE and AT-Bus 2008 have one channel at `$1000`, control
block at `$2000` (so `$2C00` is the alternate-status register the driver's
channel-autodetect polls against `$1E00`). A channel with **no drives
attached at all** floats every register, not only status: `AtaBus::read_reg`
only special-cases status/alt-status for "no drive selected", so the
front-end checks `AtaBus::any_drive_attached` itself -- without it, an
empty channel's device/head register reads a hard zero, which real
`lide.device` reads as "a device answered" and polls forever waiting for
it to respond. (Found and fixed by booting a downloaded `lide.rom` under
RIPPLE with only channel 0 populated -- see `ide_zorro.rs`'s tests and
module docs.)

**ROM window and banking.** The flash is byte-wide, so a 32K bank fills 64K
of window at even addresses (stride 2; the odd lane on AT-Bus 2008, whose
`er_InitDiagVec` is `1` rather than `8` for exactly this reason). Before
the first write anywhere in the window, ROM covers the whole window (bank
selected by address bit 16 -- bank 1 being the optional CD filesystem);
that first write latches `ide_enabled`, after which ROM remains only in
the upper 64K (RIPPLE also keeps it in the low 64K wherever address bits
12 and 13 agree, which is exactly where the register blocks above are
not). The bank register is written anywhere in `$8000-$FFFF`: RIPPLE has
two banks and it is write-only; RIDE has four and reads back with
`otherram_en`/`maprom_en` on the next nibble down. AT-Bus 2008 has no latch
and no banking: its image sits on the odd lane across the whole window,
always. None of the three boards wire an interrupt line -- `lide.device`
is a purely polling driver.

**ROM is always user-supplied** (`rom`, optionally `rom_bank2`): LIV2's
GitHub releases ship `lide.rom` (RIPPLE/RIDE), `lide-atbus.rom`, and
`cdfs.rom`, all 32768 bytes; Copperline never bundles or distributes them.
Omitting `rom` is hardware-only mode: no DiagArea, no autoboot, `diag_vec`
absent from the `BoardSpec`, but drives still answer once a disk-loaded
driver finds them.

All three personalities have booted a real `lide.rom`/`lide-atbus.rom`
release end-to-end to a real Workbench (Kickstart 1.3 and 3.1, `--cpu
68020`): AutoConfig, the DiagArea, `lide.device` loading as a resident
module, finding an attached drive, and mounting a boot node from a real
RDB image.

AT-Bus 2008's ROM and register blocks share address space by byte lane
(ROM odd, registers even, per above), including inside the control block
at `$2000`: the board's read dispatch used to match the control block
first regardless of lane, so odd-lane reads there -- exactly where the
boot ROM's chainloader fetches its relocatable driver payload -- floated
as an unpopulated register instead of reaching ROM. `lide.device` never
loaded and the machine never got past the "insert disk" screen; RIPPLE and
RIDE were unaffected, since their ROM sits on the even lane, clear of any
register. Fixed by checking the ROM lane ahead of the register-block
dispatch in `IdeZorro::read()` (see `ide_zorro.rs`'s tests).

## Host filesystem service (`filesys.rs`)

`[[filesys]]` mounts export host directories as live AmigaDOS volumes
(`HOSTFS0:` ... up to 8 mounts), with no disk image in between -- distinct
from the `dirfs.rs` path above, which snapshots a directory into an
in-memory FFS or OFS volume behind a virtual drive. The guest side is a tiny
handler (see `guest/services/`) mapped into the Copperline services board
with a mount table and a hand-built DiagArea. DiagPoint only patches a
Romtag into the retained diag copy; Kickstart's cold-start resident scan
calls its rt_Init once DOS-list surgery is actually safe (doing it
straight out of raw DiagPoint context corrupts Kickstart 1.3's own boot),
and rt_Init builds one DeviceNode per mount and `AddBootNode`s it (at the
mount's configured boot priority), so DOS mounts the devices at boot. The
handler probes the library versions at runtime and falls back to the
1.3-era calls on Kickstart 1.3: `AddDosNode` for a non-boot mount, and a
hand-built BootNode `Enqueue()`d on `eb_MountList` (mirroring the
V34-era A590/A2091 boot ROM recipe) for a bootable one, so `bootpri`
boots the machine from a hostfs volume on 1.3 exactly as it does on
2.0+. V34's own boot-time handler startup carries BCPL process
parameters rather than a V36 `ACTION_STARTUP` (`dp_Arg3` is NULL; the
handler locates its unit through `dp_Arg2`'s `FileSysStartupMsg`
instead). The handler forwards
every DosPacket to the host through a doorbell register in the board's
MMIO window: writing the packet APTR to `REG_DOSPKT` services the packet
synchronously inside the register write, so `dp_Res1`/`dp_Res2` and the
result registers are filled before the next guest instruction runs. All
`ACTION_*` semantics -- reads, writes, create/rename/delete, directory
walks, protection, comments, datestamps -- are implemented host-side
against the real filesystem, with results written straight into guest
memory.

Each mount unit owns its own bank of longword registers in the window
(layout shared with the guest via `guest/services/copperline_board.h`):
`REG_MSGPORT` publishes the handler process's MsgPort while the unit is
live, and `REG_RESULT`/`REG_ARG` tell the handler what to do with the
packet it just rang in (reply it, `AddDosEntry` a host-built volume
DosList node, or exit on `ACTION_DIE`). One handler process runs per
unit against its own bank, so mounts never synchronize with each other.
A single global `DIAG_DOORBELL` strobe carries the expansion-init work,
which runs before any handler process exists. That init strobe is also
where `[machine] rom_scsi_device_disable` takes effect: the board's
DiagPoint culls the ROM's `scsi.device` resident tag (`romtags.rs`),
which is why setting the flag instantiates the services board even with
no `[[filesys]]` mounts configured.

These longword registers are written with a single `move.l` in the guest
ROM/handler, but on a 68000/68010 that compiles to two word-sized bus
cycles (high word, then low word -- a real 16-bit-bus artifact the CPU
core reproduces). The board fires each doorbell (`DIAG_DOORBELL`,
`REG_DOSPKT`, `REG_MSGPORT`) on whichever write actually completes the
value -- a single 4-byte access on a 32-bit bus, or the low word of a
split pair on a 16-bit one -- reading the result back out of the already-
latched window image rather than trusting the write that triggered it.

Amiga attributes a host filesystem cannot hold live in UAE-style `.uaem`
sidecar files (read when present, written back on change, hidden from
guest listings); the delete-protection bit is honoured on
`ACTION_DELETE_OBJECT`. Filenames map between host UTF-8 and guest
Latin-1, hiding names with no Latin-1 spelling; host symlinks are
followed (the guest cannot create one, so a symlink is the host user
deliberately grafting a tree into the mount), while path escapes that a
guest could construct on its own (`..`, embedded separators) are
blocked. A `readonly`
mount refuses writes with the standard write-protection error.

## A2065 Ethernet (`a2065.rs`, `net/`)

The `[a2065]` option fits a Commodore A2065: a Zorro II board carrying an
Am7990 LANCE and 32 KiB of on-board RAM, driven by the AmigaOS SANA-II
`a2065.device`. Unlike the DMAC boards the LANCE never masters the Amiga
bus: its init block, descriptor rings, and packet buffers all live in the
board's own RAM, which the CPU reaches through the board window, so the
board is self-contained and owns a host `NetBackend` (`net/`) for real
frames. The LANCE engine models the Am7990 programming surface a real
driver exercises: TX and RX buffer chaining (STP..ENP spans across
descriptors), the stored FCS trailer (MCNT counts it; drivers read the
payload as `MCNT - 4`), the init-block MODE gates (DTX/DRX and the LOOP
internal-loopback self-test SANA-II drivers run at power-up), and MISS on
an RX ring overrun.

The `nat` backend (`net/nat/`, `net-nat` build feature) is a slirp-style
userspace NAT: a dedicated `a2065-nat` thread owns a smoltcp interface
that terminates ARP and the guest's TCP on the virtual gateway
(10.0.2.2, DNS forwarder 10.0.2.3, guest 10.0.2.15/24), splices each TCP
flow onto a non-blocking host socket, NATs UDP per flow, resolves DNS
through the host's own resolver, and answers BOOTP/DHCP and ICMP echo at
frame level. Frames cross to the emulated NIC over bounded channels that
drop on overflow, so the emulator thread never blocks on the host
network. Networking is inherently non-deterministic, so a fitted NIC
breaks byte-identical replay while traffic flows; save states record only
the chosen backend and bring up a fresh one on load (flows die; the
guest's TCP retransmits). The board and backend story, including the WASM
plugin `net` capability, is covered in [](../zorro).

The `bridge` backend (`net/bridge/`, `net-bridge` build feature) uses the
same bounded worker boundary but carries unmodified Ethernet frames to a
selected physical adapter: AF_PACKET on Linux, system libpcap/BPF on macOS,
and runtime-loaded Npcap on Windows. A platform filter and a second software
guard admit only the guest station address and multicast/broadcast, while
guest-source capture echo is discarded. The LANCE's init-block PADR updates
that filter. Linux's companion process owns only `CAP_NET_RAW`, validates an
interface request, and passes a bound descriptor with `SCM_RIGHTS`; it never
handles a frame. Backend construction is fallible so bridge errors abort
machine startup or state restoration rather than changing connectivity.

## HostSocket (`hostsocket.rs`, `crates/hostsocket-plugin/`, `guest/hostsocket/`)

The `[hostsocket]` option fits the bundled HostSocket board: guest-facing
`bsdsocket.library` backed by a smoltcp TCP/IP stack on the host, so socket
applications run with no guest network stack at all. It is deliberately
*not* a native device like the A2065 but a WASM plugin board hosted by
`wasmboard.rs`, with its module and guest stub ROM embedded in the binary
(`hostsocket.rs` holds the bytes and expands the config section into an
ordinary plugin-board entry whose module path is a sentinel the plugin host
and save-state restore resolve). The plugin boundary is what makes the
board save-state-clean: the entire TCP/IP stack -- smoltcp interface,
socket set, fd table, DNS state -- lives in the module's linear memory,
which snapshots and restores byte-for-byte like Amiga RAM; a native port
would have to hand-serialize live smoltcp state, which smoltcp does not
support. The guest side (`guest/hostsocket/`) installs the library via an
`rt_Init`-deferred Romtag (safe on real Kickstart 1.3/3.1 and AROS) and
stages each LVO through a Forbid-bracketed register-window RPC, with a
wake-queue interrupt path for blocking calls -- the same host-does-the-work
pattern as the services board's hostfs handler. The board reuses the shared
`NetBackend`s above through the plugin `net` capability; `loopback` is
deterministic, `nat`/`bridge` are not. `gethostbyname()` defaults to the
plugin ABI's `resolve` capability under `net = "nat"`/`"bridge"`
(`resolve_start`/`resolve_poll` in `wasmboard.rs`, `register_host_fns`),
resolving via the host's own OS resolver on a short-lived background
thread -- the same `getaddrinfo`-on-a-thread shape the NAT DNS forwarder
above already uses, reused directly (`net::nat::dns::resolve_a`) rather than
reimplemented -- so it works out of the box under `net = "bridge"` with no
`dns_server` hand-configured to match the LAN. `[hostsocket] resolver =
"dns"` opts back into the board speaking DNS itself over that same `net`
traffic, to target a specific server instead of the host's own resolver.
The library's own LVO table covers the real bsdsocket_lib.sfd order from
`socket()` all the way to the table's real end at LVO -858 (confirmed
against Olaf Barthel's own authoritative `.sfd`, not just the -30..-300
range Phase 4 originally shipped, and not just the AmiTCP-4.0-compatible
subset through `ObtainServerSocket` at -696) -- `inet_aton`/`inet_ntop`/
`inet_pton`, `In_LocalAddr`/`In_CanForward`, the `setservent`/`setprotoent`/
`setnetent` iterator families, and Roadshow's own resolver-family extension
(`getaddrinfo`/`getnameinfo`/`gai_strerror`/`freeaddrinfo`, plus the
reentrant `gethostbyname_r`/`gethostbyaddr_r`) all get real bodies too,
while the LVOs with no equivalent in this project's model (raw packet
capture, host routing tables, live interface reconfiguration, direct BSD
mbuf-chain manipulation, Roadshow's own internal global-data-access
functions) stay `_hs_stub` rather than jumping off the end of the table
(see `guest/hostsocket/entry.s`'s own jump-table comment for the full
accounting).

## zz9k crypto board (`zz9k.rs`, `crates/zz9k-plugin/`)

The `[zz9k]` option fits the bundled ZZ9000 SDK crypto board: a
register-compatible subset of the MNT ZZ9000's SDK v2 service platform
(CORE + MEMORY + CRYPTO) whose crypto runs host-side on pure-Rust
RustCrypto inside the plugin, so the zz9000-sdk's unmodified Amiga
software -- transport library, tools, accelerated AmiSSL -- offloads
TLS-era crypto at host speed. Like HostSocket it is a bundled WASM plugin
board with a path-sentinel module, but unlike every other bundled board it
autoconfigs under MNT's own manufacturer ID (0x6D6E, product 4/3): the
SDK's `FindConfigDev` probe is the detection mechanism, so compatibility
*is* the identity. The whole board -- registers, ring mailbox, and the
shared-buffer heap the guest copies payloads through -- is one byte array
in the plugin's linear memory; there is no DMA, no network, and no host
randomness (key-exchange scalars always come from the guest), which keeps
the board pure compute and therefore deterministic, replay-safe, and
save-state-exact including mid-operation (pending completions carry
remaining-colour-clock counters, never host time). Requests are picked up
by the plugin's tick scanning the request ring -- the SDK's Zorro II
transport never rings the doorbell -- computed at dispatch, and completed
after a deterministic latency table, one request per tick so no single
wasm call approaches the plugin fuel budget. The register/opcode contract,
the pinned zz9000-sdk revision, and every firmware-latitude choice are
specified in [](zz9k.md).

## CDTV (`cdtv.rs`, `cdrom.rs`)

The CDTV model pairs the DMAC (which autoconfigs ahead of the Zorro chain,
as on the real machine -- the CDTV firmware requires the DMAC to be the
first configured board) with a Matshita drive speaking its fixed-length
command/response protocol: seek, read, play (LSN/MSF/track), status, SubQ,
and TOC queries, with responses delivered byte-by-byte with STEN pulses.
Data sectors DMA onto the system bus at the 24-bit ACR address -- chip,
slow, or Zorro board RAM, like the A2091's DMAC; Kickstart allocates the
CD buffers in fast RAM when a board is fitted -- paced at single speed and
raising the DMAC interrupt on completion. The 256 KiB extended ROM sits at
`$F00000`.

## CD32 Akiko (`akiko.rs`)

Akiko sits at `$B80000` with its `$C0CACAFE` ID: the chunky-to-planar
converter, the I2C lines to the 24C08 NVRAM EEPROM (persisted to the
`[cd] nvram` file), and the CD command/response rings talking to a Chinon
drive model (stop, pause, seek/play/read, LED, SubQ, status). Data sectors
stream as 2352-byte raw frames at 75 (or 150 at 2x) sectors/second; CD
audio mixes into the host output, and both light the blue CD LED. The
512 KiB extended ROM sits at `$E00000`, and the CD32 pad protocol drives
port 2.

The drive protocol is cross-checked against both ROM drivers known to have
run on real hardware, Kickstart's cd.device and AROS's, which pinned down
four behaviours where the two disagree with older emulator lore: the drive
microcontroller answers a command about a millisecond after its last byte
rather than inside the guest's register write (drivers arm their
completion interrupt in that window); the TOC dump streams the track
entries before the A0/A1/A2 session entries, since a parser may treat the
lead-out entry as end-of-TOC; the CDINTREQ status read exposes only
enabled sources (`intreq & intena`), because INT2 servers read it on every
chain entry and a stale latch from a disabled source must not look like
fresh work; and the media-status packet reports a present disc as `$83`
(Kickstart masks the byte with 3, AROS compares it whole -- only `$83`
satisfies both). Akiko's DMA engines drive a full 24-bit address bus (the
address registers mask to `$00FFF000`), so the rings and sector buffers
resolve through every RAM bank in the low 16 MB -- Zorro II fast RAM
included, which is where AROS places its `MEMF_24BITDMA` allocations when
fast RAM exists -- not just chip RAM.

`cdrom.rs` parses cue sheets (single- or multi-file; MODE1/2048,
MODE1/2352, and AUDIO tracks; `PREGAP`/`POSTGAP` as unstored zero-fill
extents, like a CHD's gaps) for both machines and the SCSI/ATAPI drives,
and lays every `FILE` out as a run of extents over a byte-addressed
source. A `BINARY` source is the file itself; a `WAVE` or `MP3` source
(`cdrom/audio.rs`) presents the decoded audio as CD-DA sectors --
588 stereo frames per sector, the last sector zero-padded, other sample
rates linearly interpolated in integer arithmetic -- so the layout code
sees only sector bytes. Decoding is on demand: a WAV is random access
(`cdrom/wav.rs`, via `hound`); an MP3 (`cdrom/mp3.rs`, Symphonia's
decoder behind the `cd-mp3` feature) is indexed at load without decoding
(frames located by header, ID3v2 skipped, a Xing/Info frame dropped, a
LAME tag's encoder delay and padding trimmed) and then decoded by a
cursor that follows sequential reads. A jump warms a fresh decoder up on
as many earlier frames as it takes to refill the Layer III bit reservoir
(511 bytes of main data for MPEG-1, 255 for MPEG-2/2.5 -- sized in bytes
from the frame index, since a frame at the bottom of the MPEG-2 range
carries only a byte or two of main data) plus the one-frame-deep
overlap-add and synthesis state, so a sector decodes to the same bytes
whichever way the cursor reached it; that is what keeps a run resumed
from a save state byte-identical to an uninterrupted one, and a unit
test holds it to that down to 8 kbps streams.
A save state records each file's path, format, and sector byte length and
reopens (re-indexes) it on load.

## RTC (`rtc.rs`)

An MSM6242-compatible register view at `$DC0000`, present on machines
configured with `rtc = true`. Reads reflect host time; guest writes only
affect the emulated latch/control state, never the host clock.

The part is four bits wide and wired to the low byte lane alone, so it answers
on odd addresses while the even lane floats with the bus -- with or without a
chip in the socket, since nothing else drives it either. The register select is
A2-A5, so A1 does not reach the decode and each register answers at both of its
odd bytes (register 0 at `+1` and `+3`, register 1 at `+5` and `+7`, ...);
AmigaOS uses `$DC0000 + N * 4 + 3` by convention, not because the part is deaf
at `+1`. Writes take the same lanes as reads.
With `rtc = false` the page still answers the cycle, and the odd lane reads
back `$40` (measured on real A500 hardware) rather than floating. That
distinction matters: every OS clock probe -- AROS `battclock.resource`,
1.3's `SetClock`, 2.0+'s `battclock.resource` -- decides a clock is present
by writing a control nibble and reading it back, so a lane floating to the
last value on the data bus eventually echoes the write and hands the guest
an imaginary clock, and then an imaginary date.

## Input (`gamepad.rs`, window input paths)

Host keyboard events translate to Amiga raw codes and feed a 6500/1
keyboard-MCU model (`chipset/keyboard.rs`) that clocks each event into
CIA-A bit by bit over the emulated KCLK/KDAT lines: 60 us bit cells,
the KDAT handshake after every byte (the MCU samples the line within
microseconds and accepts any deliberate pulse, so software that reads
the keyboard with a brief handshake -- e.g. Pinball Dreams at ~13.5 us
-- works, not just the boot ROM's longer pulse), lost-sync recovery
(lone sync bits, $F9, retransmission), the $FD/$FE power-up stream,
the $78/KCLK-low reset protocol behind Ctrl+Amiga+Amiga, Caps Lock's
keyboard-owned LED toggle, a 10-event type-ahead buffer with $FA
overflow, and ghost suppression on the real A500 key matrix (the seven
qualifiers are on dedicated lines and never ghost). The protocol was
cross-checked against real-hardware-validated replacement keyboard
firmware. Mouse deltas
feed the JOY0DAT quadrature counters. Gamepads are read through `gilrs`
with its bundled SDL controller database enabled: a recognised pad
resolves through a fixed standard layout, overridden per-UUID by the
calibration described in [](../guide/ui), which records raw event codes
(one per control, plus an optional alternate per direction so a stick
and a d-pad can both steer) and is the only path for unrecognised pads.
A direction pair recorded on the two ends of one raw axis is reported
as that stick's deflection as well, which is what the gamepad-mouse
device paces the pointer by. On CD32 machines the pad
output is serialized through the CD32 pad protocol instead of the plain
digital joystick lines, modelled after the pad's 4021 shift register:
in load mode the register's output follows Blue continuously (which is
how Blue doubles as the plain second button on POTxY), and while the
register is clocking each shifted bit reflects only its own button
line, a held Blue included.

The window layer has one host-source policy for the emulated port-2
joystick/CD32 pad: gamepad (the default) or keyboard. Keyboard mode
skips gamepad polling for port-2 input; gamepad mode disables keyboard
joystick capture so the mapped keys take the normal Amiga keyboard path.
(The old auto-detect mode has been removed; `"auto"` in a config parses
as a backward-compatibility alias for gamepad.) Both sources ultimately
call the same `InputState::set_joystick_port2`
and `set_cd32_buttons_port2` helpers, so JOY1DAT, /FIR1, POT1Y/POTGOR, and
the CD32 serial bits remain hardware-derived.

Keyboard joystick emulation is deliberately a host input source, not a
guest-keyboard behaviour. When active, the winit key handler consumes the
mapped host keys before rawkey translation: cursor keys drive directions,
Right Ctrl/Right Alt drive fire, and the CD32 extras are C/X/D/S/Return/Z/A.
Each alias is tracked independently before resolving to a single joystick
state, so releasing one fire alias does not clear fire while another alias
is still held. Releases for keys already captured as joystick controls are
also swallowed if the source mode changes before key-up, preventing stray
Amiga rawkey releases.

## Audio output (`audio.rs`)

`AudioSink` abstracts the host boundary: a cpal live sink, a WAV-file sink
(`--audio-wav`), and a null sink (`--noaudio`). Paula renders in emulated
time; the live sink resamples and buffers against wall-clock. The
`CPAL_*` lead/prebuffer/stale-drop targets in `audio.rs` are fixed rather
than adaptive (currently a 131072-frame ring, a ~150 ms prebuffer equal to
the ~150 ms steady lead, and a ~300 ms stale-drop threshold at 44.1 kHz).
Playback starts only after the first audible frames have filled that
prebuffer, so silent boot/load periods do not queue seconds of zeros. If the
cpal callback later drains the queue completely, it stops playback, outputs
silence, and waits for the same prebuffer depth before restarting. While an
already-started queue is merely below target, the sink reports the missing
buffer depth as extra live-audio lead so the real-time pacer runs ahead and
restores the cushion without forcing a host-side silence gap first.

The live queue is host presentation state, not Paula state. A save-state or
reverse-debug timeline jump keeps the restored Paula/CD/floppy mixer state but
discards queued cpal frames from the abandoned timeline, then rebuilds the live
prebuffer from the restored emulated audio stream. Offline WAV capture is not
affected by any of this buffering policy.

Two profiling knobs cover the audio/pacing boundary, both emitting one
`info` line per second:

- `COPPERLINE_AUDIO_PROFILE=1` -- live-audio queue depth and the cpal
  callback counters (callbacks, callback frames, estimated device CCK,
  plus cumulative underrun/overrun/stale-frame totals). The cpal callback
  itself never logs; it only updates atomic counters under this flag.
- `COPPERLINE_REAL_PACING_PROFILE=1` -- the real-speed pacing line:
  retired instructions, raw `m68k` cycles, chip-bus wait CCK, device CCK,
  CPU chip-bus slots, host sleep count/time, and wall-time late
  count/time. Kept separate so CPU/device pacing can be measured without
  enabling the lower-level cpal counters.

Default live-audio warnings are emitted from the producer side at the same
one-second cadence, and only when an underrun, overrun, or stale-frame
counter is nonzero.

(serial-sink)=

## Serial (`serial.rs`)

Paula's SERDAT transmit path lands on a `SerialSink`. The default
`StdoutSink` prints to the host terminal -- this
is how DiagROM's diagnostic stream and the `timing-test/` results are
captured in terminals and CI logs. `TcpSerialSink` bridges the port to a
listening TCP socket (`[serial] mode = "tcp"`, one client at a time) or
dials out to a remote endpoint (`mode = "tcp-connect"` with `connect =
"host:port"` -- the BBS-client wiring), and `PtySerialSink` bridges to a
host pseudo-terminal pair (`mode = "pty"`, Unix only); all are
bidirectional, so an `AUX:` shell on the Amiga side gives a remote
AmigaDOS console. The browser build swaps in a channel-backed sink that
the page bridges to a WebSocket.

A `SerialSink` that can *produce* input must override
`has_pending_input` alongside `read_byte`/`read_word`:
Paula's per-tick UART step takes an idle fast path that skips the receiver
entirely while it reports false -- the TCP and pty sinks poll a counter
there, never a syscall.

The sink is also the device on the far end of the RS-232 cable, so it owns
the handshake inputs. `SerialSink::control_lines` reports DSR, CTS, and
carrier detect as asserted-or-not (`SerialControlLines`); the bus samples
it on every guest read of CIA-B PRA and overlays PA3-5 with the levels the
motherboard's inverting 1489 receivers would present (asserted = pin low,
undriven = pulled high), leaving pins the guest has switched to outputs
CIA-driven -- the same shape as the Centronics status overlay on PA0-2.
The guest's `/DTR` (PA7) and `/RTS` (PA6) outputs are the CIA's own pins,
readable by a host bridge through `Cia::port_a_pins`. The default is an
unplugged cable (every input high), which is what the inert and MIDI sinks
keep; `StdoutSink` is a ready device with no carrier; `TcpSerialSink`
is a modem whose carrier follows the live connection (an atomic flag the
acceptor/reader thread maintains, so the PRA read never touches the
writer lock); `PtySerialSink` is a null-modem peer with its port open;
`ChannelSerialSink` starts ready-without-carrier and lets the frontend set
the lines (`ChannelSerialHandle::set_carrier`, exported to the browser as
`serial_set_carrier`). The lines are host-side state like the bytes
themselves -- never serialized, never part of the deterministic timeline.
Paula has no framing-error or parity hardware: a received word always
carries its stop bit(s) set, and `serial.device` computes parity in
software, so neither needs a model here.

CCP serial observability is a host-side tap beside `SerialSink`, not another
serial device. When a control connection subscribes, each successfully
completed transmit word is copied into a 4,096-entry `VecDeque`; the normal
sink receives the same word immediately. Overflow evicts and counts the
oldest observation, so a debugger cannot back-pressure Paula. The tap is
skipped by serde and carried across state loads with the live serial/audio
sinks; disconnecting or unsubscribing removes it.

## MIDI serial bridge (`midi/`)

`[serial] mode = "midi"` (or `--midi-out`/`--midi-in`) bridges Paula's
serial port to host MIDI, behind the optional `midi` cargo feature -- a
plain build compiles none of it and the mode falls back with a clear
message. The whole thing hangs off one `SerialSink`, `MidiSerialSink`, so
the emulator core is unchanged from any other serial target.

The load-bearing detail is that byte timing survives to the wire. Paula
stamps each transmitted byte with the emulated colour clock it left on
(`SerialTimeAnchor`); `MidiSerialSink` maps that to a host `Instant` and
asks the backend to *schedule* the message for that instant rather than
send it now, so a frame's worth of bytes flushed together still leaves at
the original spacing. Two host-agnostic pieces sit above the backend: a
`MidiFramer` reassembles the single-byte serial stream into whole MIDI
messages (a receiver rejects lone data bytes), tracking running status and
SysEx and passing interleaved real-time bytes straight through; and Active
Sensing (`0xFE`) is forwarded by default -- a real Amiga passes it down the
wire -- and only dropped under `COPPERLINE_MIDI_STRIP_ACTIVE_SENSE=1`.
Input arrives on a lock-free SPSC ring the receiver drains on its idle
fast path, so the poll never locks.

The host connection lives behind the `MidiBackend` trait, chosen by
`cfg(target_os)`: macOS drives CoreMIDI (`coremidi.rs`), Linux the ALSA
sequencer (`alsa.rs`), and Windows WinMM (`winmm.rs`); any other target gets
`stub.rs`, which enumerates nothing and refuses to open. Each backend links its
platform library directly with no wrapper crate, and each maps the
scheduled send onto that platform's timed-delivery primitive: a CoreMIDI
packet timestamp, an ALSA real-time queue event, or -- since WinMM carries no
timestamp -- a scheduler thread that fires each message when it comes due. A
new backend implements `send`/`set_output`/`set_input`/`current_output`/`current_input`
plus free `enumerate`/`open`; nothing else changes. The raw FFI is
layout-sensitive -- CoreMIDI packs its packet list to 4 bytes, the ALSA
`snd_seq_event_t` scheduling helpers are header-only inlines whose field writes
are replicated by hand, and WinMM's `MIDIHDR` is packed -- so the mirrors are
pinned with compile-time layout assertions and want checking against live MIDI,
not just review.

On macOS the process holds exactly one `MIDIClient`, created at first use
(enumeration included) and never disposed. CoreMIDI's link to the MIDIServer
daemon is per-process and does not recover: the daemon exits a few seconds
after the system-wide last client is disposed, and a process whose link dies
that way cannot create a client again until it is relaunched. The one held
client keeps the daemon running for the app's lifetime; each machine's
backend owns only its ports.

Two debug knobs help tell a dead path from a routing one:
`COPPERLINE_MIDI_DEBUG=1` reports per-second tx/rx byte counts and the
first bytes sent (no tx while a song plays means the guest is not driving
serial, i.e. the fault is upstream of the bridge); `=2` decodes every
message in each direction. `COPPERLINE_MIDI_IMMEDIATE=1` bypasses
scheduling and sends each message for immediate delivery, to separate a
timing problem from a connection one.

## Parallel port peripherals (`parallel.rs`, `sampler.rs`)

The Centronics port's peripheral boundary is the `ParallelPort` trait.
CIA-A port B (`$BFE101`) carries the eight data pins and CIA-A's `PC`
output is the active-low printer strobe: the bus forwards each strobe
with the physical pin levels, and a peripheral that accepts the byte
returns true, which the bus turns into the printer's active-low `/ACK`
edge on CIA-A FLAG. An input peripheral instead drives the data pins
itself on every CIA-A port-B read. The status lines BUSY, POUT, and SEL
are CIA-B port A pins 0-2, peripheral-driven inputs with motherboard
pull-ups. The default null peripheral is an unplugged cable: it neither
acknowledges nor drives any pin, and the pulled-up status lines read all
high.

`[parallel] device = "printer"` captures strobed bytes to the configured
output file (`FileParallelPort`), holding the status lines at
ready-online levels (SEL high, BUSY and POUT low) -- without those,
`parallel.device` polls BUSY forever and never sends a byte. `device =
"sampler"` fits the classic mono 8-bit parallel-port digitizer
(AMAS/DSS-class, modelled on the open-amiga-sampler schematics): a host
capture stream fills a ring in real time and each port-B read returns
the sample for the elapsed *emulated* time, so recordings line up
however fast or slow the Amiga polls. Samples are 8-bit offset-binary
(128 = silence), host left and right are summed to the mono input, and
the preamp gain is clamped to +/-24 dB. `COPPERLINE_SAMPLER_DEBUG=1`
logs the captured input level about once a second -- a CLI VU meter for
checking the host microphone is feeding the port.
