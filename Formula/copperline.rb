# Homebrew formula for Copperline.
#
# This repository doubles as its own Homebrew tap. Because it builds from
# source, the resulting binary is compiled on the user's machine and is not
# subject to macOS Gatekeeper quarantine -- no Security & Privacy override is
# ever needed. Install with:
#
#   brew tap copperlinehq/copperline https://github.com/CopperlineHQ/Copperline
#   brew install copperline
#
# or build the in-development tree directly:
#
#   brew install --HEAD copperline
#
# When tagging a release, update both `url` and `sha256` below. Compute the
# checksum from the tagged tarball:
#
#   curl -fsSL https://github.com/CopperlineHQ/Copperline/archive/refs/tags/vX.Y.Z.tar.gz | shasum -a 256
