//! SF2000 accelerator Zorro II SD card controller (`sdcard.v`): a 64K I/O
//! window over an SPI-mode SD card, register-compatible with the real
//! hardware's `sdcard.v`/`shifter.v`/`fifo.v`/`tx_cpu_buf.v`/`rx_cpu_buf.v`.
//!
//! ## Boot ROM: odd lane, stride 2, latched live on first write
//!
//! The RTL available for this board is a development build with no boot ROM
//! wired up; the production board carries one. Confirmed against the real
//! firmware's `bootrom/bootldr.S` and `bootrom/mungerom.py` (the `spisd2`
//! driver source): the flash image sits on the *odd* byte lane at stride 2
//! -- `window[2k+1] = rom[k]`, even lane floats -- exactly like
//! `ide_zorro.rs`'s AT-Bus 2008 personality, and a 32K image spans the
//! whole 64K window with no mirroring. `bootldr.S`'s own relocation code
//! computes the driver payload's window offset as the flash offset "times
//! 4 (nibble-wise DiagArea)": one factor of 2 is `mungerom.py` doubling the
//! DiagArea/bootstrap portion of the image into nibble-padded bytes for
//! Kickstart 1.3's nibble-only DiagArea scanner (baked into the ROM file's
//! own content -- Kickstart does the nibble reassembly in software, nothing
//! for Copperline to do there), and the other factor of 2 is this odd-lane
//! stride. `er_InitDiagVec` is `0x0001`, i.e. window offset 1 = `rom[0]`.
//!
//! Gated the same way `ide_zorro.rs`'s RIPPLE/RIDE personalities are, on top
//! of the lane split: before the first write anywhere in the window, the
//! odd lane reads the ROM and the even lane floats; that first write
//! latches the interface live, and from then on the whole window is the
//! register file described below (odd lane floats there too -- see the
//! data-port row), with no ROM visible anywhere. `rom` absent (or `""`) is
//! hardware-only mode: registers are live immediately, no autoboot, the
//! card still works under a disk-loaded driver.
//!
//! ## Register map
//!
//! The whole 64K window mirrors one 32-byte register block (`off & 0x1F`),
//! word-addressed:
//!
//! | Offset | Register | Access | Meaning |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `0x00` | CLKDIV | rw | SPI clock divider (stored/read back; not used to pace timing -- see below) |
//! | `0x02` | SLAVE_SEL | rw, bit0 | chip select (stored/read back only) |
//! | `0x04` | CARD_DET | ro, bit0 | 1 iff a card image is attached |
//! | `0x06` | STATUS | ro | see [`Sf2000Sd::status`] |
//! | `0x08` | SHIFT_CTRL | wo | bits 15:14 mode (0 stop/1 rx/2 tx/3 both), bits 12:0 rx length; word access only |
//! | `0x0A` | INTREQ | rw, bit0 | card-detect-changed pending; write 1 to clear |
//! | `0x0C` | INTENA | rw, bit0 | enable that interrupt |
//! | `0x0E` | INTACT | ro | INTREQ & INTENA |
//! | `0x10`-`0x1E` | DATA | rw | TX/RX data port (byte: upper lane only, matching `ide_zorro.rs`'s task-file convention; word: hi byte first) |
//!
//! **Timing simplification**: `CLKDIV` paces real SCLK bit timing on
//! hardware; a polled register protocol has no need for cycle-accurate SPI
//! timing to behave correctly (`ide_zorro.rs`'s task-file registers already
//! respond instantly rather than modelling real ATA bus timing), so it is
//! stored/read back faithfully but otherwise unused. What *is* modelled
//! faithfully is the FIFO **backpressure contract**, since driver code loops
//! on `busy`/FIFO-empty to pace transfers: the RX queue is capacity-34 (32
//! FIFO + 2-stage CPU buffer, matching the RTL); a `SHIFT_CTRL` receive
//! request tops it up to capacity immediately and tracks the remainder,
//! refilling one byte per drained read until exhausted -- `busy` (STATUS bit
//! 6) is set exactly while bytes are still outstanding. The TX side keeps no
//! queue at all: a data-port write in TX/BOTH mode is handed to the card
//! synchronously (see `crate::sdcard::SdCard::clock_byte`), so TX is always
//! reported empty/not-full.
//!
//! Card detect has no debounce and never changes at runtime: the card is a
//! config-fixed attachment in this version (no hot-swap), so `CARD_DET`
//! simply reflects whether an image was configured, and the INTREQ/INTENA
//! card-detect-changed interrupt path exists for register-contract
//! completeness without ever actually firing.
