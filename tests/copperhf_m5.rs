//! Verification for copperhf.device's M5 milestone (asynchronous worker-
//! thread I/O, `COPPERHF-DEVICE-PLAN.md`'s "M5 -- Asynchronous I/O"): the
//! guest-visible register protocol is unchanged (`guest/copperhf/
//! copperhf_board.h` is frozen across M5 -- see `docs/internals/
//! copperhf.md`'s device-stub section), but the *host* side now answers
//! doorbells from a worker thread instead of executing them synchronously
//! on the emulation thread. Two properties are the whole point of this
//! milestone and this file pins both down against a real AROS boot that
//! does real doorbell I/O:
//!
//! - [`determinism`]: **determinism**. Copperline's core is deterministic
//!   and byte-for-byte reproducible independent of wall-clock pacing
//!   (`AGENTS.md`); moving I/O onto a worker thread must not leak wall-clock
//!   scheduling into the emulated timeline. Completions must land at
//!   emulated times that are a pure function of emulated time, not of
//!   however fast the worker thread happened to run on this particular
//!   invocation. Two runs of the same copperhf-heavy scenario are held to a
//!   savestate captured mid-boot (the sharpest artifact available: it
//!   encodes the machine's exact cycle/timeline position, not just what
//!   ended up on screen) plus a final screenshot.
//! - [`savestate_quiesce_and_resume`]: **savestate quiesce**. Saving state
//!   while copperhf I/O is in flight must block until the worker has
//!   drained, so a resumed run is byte-identical to an uninterrupted one
//!   (`AGENTS.md`'s "Save states": "A resumed run is byte-identical to an
//!   uninterrupted one"). The save point is chosen inside the busy
//!   mounter/startup-sequence I/O window specifically to exercise the
//!   quiesce path, not some quiet moment after it.
//!
//! Scenario: the M3 mounter's hand-built RDSK/PART image (see
//! `tests/copperhf_mounter.rs`, whose image-builder and OFS root-directory
//! reader are copied here rather than shared -- no common test module
//! exists in this crate yet, and per this milestone's task split, existing
//! test files are not to be edited to add one). Booting from it drives real
//! doorbell traffic end to end: the boot-ROM mounter's polled RDSK/PART walk
//! and FSHD/LSEG load, then AROS's own OFS handler reading the
//! Startup-Sequence and writing the `bootmark` marker file -- denser
//! copperhf I/O per emulated second than the M2/M4 probes' handful of
//! synchronous round trips.
//!
//! Release-only, like every other AROS-boot integration test in this suite:
//! a debug-build emulator is far too slow for a full AROS boot to a
//! Startup-Sequence.
//!
//! These tests are regression gates for the M5 *async* engine, not for
//! this milestone's absence: against a still-synchronous host
//! implementation they hold trivially (synchronous-by-construction I/O is
//! deterministic and needs no quiesce), and only start earning their keep
//! once doorbells actually complete off-thread.
