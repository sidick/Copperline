//! A built-in Zorro II IDE controller compatible with LIV2's open-source
//! `lide.device`, in three AutoConfig personalities: **RIPPLE** (the primary
//! open-hardware card, two ATA channels), **RIDE** (an expansion-port board
//! sharing RIPPLE's ROM image and register layout, one channel), and
//! **AT-Bus 2008** (the register model shared by that board's whole clone
//! family, one channel). Drives may be hard disks or ATAPI CD-ROMs, either a
//! `.cue`/`.iso`/`.nrg`/`.chd` image on any `[lide] drives` slot or a real host
//! block device attached via `[[host_disk]] attach = "lide0-master"` (etc).
//! A fitted board with no `rom` named defaults to Copperline's own bundled
//! ROM for its personality (`lide.rom` for RIPPLE/RIDE, `lide-atbus.rom`
//! for AT-Bus 2008 -- the two are different builds, not interchangeable;
//! `src/config/resolve.rs`); `rom = ""` opts out into hardware-only mode.
//!
//! ## Register map (from the LIV2 CPLD RTL)
//!
//! Each ATA channel decodes a 4K block of the board window into eight
//! task-file registers, using `(offset >> 9) & 7` as the register index --
//! ATA A0-A2 are wired to CPU A9-A11, so every register is mirrored across
//! its whole 512-byte slot (the trick that lets the driver bulk-transfer a
//! sector with `movem.l`). Registers other than the 16-bit data port sit on
//! the *upper* byte lane (even addresses, D15-D8); the odd lane and
//! unpopulated slots float 0xFF. A second 4K block per channel is the
//! control block, whose alternate-status/device-control register is fixed at
//! register index 6 (offset `+0xC00` within the block).
//!
//! RIPPLE has two channels (four drives): channel 0 at window offset
//! `0x1000`/control `0x5000`, channel 1 at `0x2000`/`0x6000`. This follows
//! the RTL's own chip-select decode (two selects per physical connector --
//! task file and control block -- rather than two separate channels sharing
//! one register layout), and has been confirmed against a real `lide.rom`
//! download: RIPPLE autoconfigs, the DiagArea runs, and `lide.device` loads
//! as a resident module and finds channel 0's drive. RIDE and AT-Bus 2008
//! have one channel: task file at `0x1000`, control block at `0x2000` (so
//! `+0x2C00` is the alternate-status register the driver's channel-autodetect
//! polls against `+0x1E00`); both have also booted successfully to a real
//! Workbench against real release ROMs.
//!
//! A channel with *no* drives attached at all (as opposed to one drive
//! present and the other slot empty) must float every register, not only
//! status -- [`AtaBus::read_reg`] only special-cases status/alt-status for
//! "no drive selected", so the register-block reader checks
//! [`AtaBus::any_drive_attached`] itself and floats the rest. Without this,
//! device/head reads back a hard zero on an empty channel, which real
//! `lide.device` reads as "a device answered" and polls forever waiting for
//! it to respond -- reproduced by booting RIPPLE with only channel 0
//! populated before this check was added.
//!
//! ## ROM window, the enable latch, and banking
//!
//! The flash is byte-wide, so each 32 KiB bank fills 64 KiB of window at
//! even byte addresses (stride 2) -- odd addresses on AT-Bus 2008, whose
//! `er_InitDiagVec` is 1 rather than 8 for exactly this reason. Before the
//! first write anywhere in the board window, ROM covers the *whole* window,
//! selecting bank 0 in the low 64K and bank 1 (the optional CD filesystem)
//! in the upper 64K. That first write latches `ide_enabled`; afterwards ROM
//! remains only in the upper 64K (RIPPLE also keeps it in the low 64K
//! wherever address bits 12 and 13 agree -- which is exactly where the task
//! file and control blocks above are *not*). AT-Bus 2008 has no latch and no
//! banking: its 32K image sits on the odd lane across the whole window,
//! always, alongside the even-lane registers.
//!
//! The bank register is written anywhere in `0x8000..0x10000`: bits 7:6 of
//! the lane byte select the bank (RIPPLE: 2 banks, write-only; RIDE: 4
//! banks, readable back with `otherram_en`/`maprom_en` on the next nibble
//! down). AT-Bus 2008 has no bank register at all.
//!
//! ## No interrupts
//!
//! None of the three boards wire ATA INTRQ anywhere -- `lide.device` is a
//! purely polling driver. [`IdeZorro`] never asserts INT2/INT6.
