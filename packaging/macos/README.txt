Copperline - macOS disk image
==============================

Copperline is a cycle-driven Amiga emulator (OCS/ECS/AGA).

Installing
----------
Drag Copperline.app onto the Applications shortcut in this window, then launch
it from Applications or Launchpad. The app is a universal binary and runs
natively on both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs.

First launch (unsigned app)
---------------------------
This build is not code-signed or notarized, so on first launch macOS Gatekeeper
will refuse to open it ("Copperline cannot be opened because the developer
cannot be verified", or "is damaged" on Apple Silicon). This is expected for an
unsigned download. To run it anyway, right-click (or Control-click)
Copperline.app and choose Open, then confirm Open in the dialog. macOS
remembers the choice, so subsequent launches open normally.

If right-click Open still refuses, clear the download quarantine from a terminal:

    xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Copperline.app

Boot ROM
--------
With no ROM of your own, Copperline boots the bundled AROS open-source
Kickstart replacement, stored inside the app at
Copperline.app/Contents/Resources/aros. AROS is freely redistributable; see the
LICENSE next to the ROM. To use a real Kickstart instead, point a config file
at it, or load it at runtime from the menu (Load Kickstart ROM...).

Copperline's bundled open Full Motion Video ROM ships in
Contents/Resources/fmv. The CD32 profile leaves that cartridge slot empty,
as a stock CD32 does; set fmv = true in a config (or press Fit on the
launcher's FMV row) to fit the module with it.

Configuration
-------------
copperline.example.toml is a starting point. Copy it, edit the paths to your
own Kickstart ROM and disk/hard-disk images, and launch from a terminal with:

    /Applications/Copperline.app/Contents/MacOS/copperline --config your-config.toml

Run that binary with --help for the full command-line surface.

Command-line tools
------------------
Two companion programs sit next to the emulator inside the bundle, in
Copperline.app/Contents/MacOS:

  copperline-ctl         Client for the control protocol (scripting and AI
                         agents), the MCP server mode (--mcp) and the Debug
                         Adapter Protocol adapter (--dap) used by the VS Code
                         extension. It launches the copperline beside it.
                         Add that directory to PATH, or point the VS Code
                         setting copperline.ctlExecutable at
                         /Applications/Copperline.app/Contents/MacOS/copperline-ctl
  copperline-import-uae  Converts a WinUAE, Amiberry or FS-UAE config file
                         into a Copperline TOML config:
                         copperline-import-uae --from winuae --in game.uae --out game.toml

Homebrew installs (brew install copperline) put the same two tools on PATH.

Bridged Ethernet
----------------
User-mode NAT needs no setup. Direct bridged Ethernet uses macOS's system
packet-capture devices. If Copperline reports that it cannot open /dev/bpf,
grant your account BPF access using your organisation's normal packet-capture
setup (commonly the access_bpf group), then log out and back in. Run
"copperline --list-net-interfaces" for adapter names. Wi-Fi bridging is
best-effort because many access points reject the Amiga's separate source MAC.
