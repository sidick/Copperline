# Copperline Amiga Debug for VS Code

Debug Amiga programs running in the [Copperline](https://copperline.dev)
emulator from VS Code: source-level breakpoints and stepping, the
register file, locals and globals, memory, the custom chipset, reverse
stepping, and the Debug Console over the emulator's control protocol.

The extension is a thin shell: it tells VS Code to run `copperline-ctl
--dap`, the Debug Adapter Protocol server built into Copperline's control
client. Everything else is in that adapter; see the Copperline
[illustrated VS Code guide](https://github.com/CopperlineHQ/Copperline/blob/main/docs/debugger/vscode.md)
for setup and the
[Debug Adapter Protocol reference](https://github.com/CopperlineHQ/Copperline/blob/main/docs/debugger/dap.md)
for all launch options. The separate
[Bartman integration guide](https://github.com/CopperlineHQ/Copperline/blob/main/docs/debugger/vscode-bartman.md)
explains how to install its Copperline fork and explore graphics profiles
without waiting for the upstream pull request.

## Requirements

- A recent Copperline build with the September 2026 debugger additions
  (the guide was tested against commit `3d334a11`). Build from current source
  until those changes are in your installed release. Every release
  package ships `copperline-ctl` next to the emulator (Homebrew on PATH,
  `Copperline.app/Contents/MacOS` on macOS, the Windows zip folder, the
  AppImage's companion tools tarball, `/app/bin` inside the Flatpak
  sandbox). Put `copperline-ctl`
  on your PATH, or use the
  `copperline.ctlExecutable` setting pointing at the executable file.
  `copperline.emulatorExecutable` names the `copperline` executable file
  to launch when it is not next to `copperline-ctl` (a source build's
  `target/release/copperline`, say).
- A program built with debug information: vasm `-linedebug`, amiga-gcc
  6.5 `-g`, or an ELF + `elf2hunk` toolchain (`symbolFile`). Without any,
  you still get hunk symbols, disassembly and registers.

## Getting started

Add a launch configuration (the *Copperline: launch a program* snippet):

```json
{
  "type": "copperline",
  "request": "launch",
  "name": "Run hello in Copperline",
  "program": "${workspaceFolder}/hello",
  "factory": true,
  "entryPoint": "main",
  "stopOnEntry": true
}
```

Press F5: Copperline opens a window, warp-boots to the program, stops at
its entry point, and the IDE shows its source. Add `"model"`, `"fast"`,
`"config"` and friends to pick the machine. `"memoryFill": "0xDEAD"`
fills cold-start RAM with a diagnostic pattern, `"fpu": true` fits an FPU,
`"stack": 32768` sets the guest CLI stack, `"ntsc": true` selects NTSC,
`"detach": true` closes the boot CLI after starting the program (Kickstart
2.0+ or AROS), and
`"emulatorLog": true` mirrors the emulator log into the Debug Console.
`"headless": true` runs without a window. Data breakpoints support read,
write, and read/write access; fitted FPU registers appear in the Registers
scope.

Normal launches also support bare Kickstart 1.3: Copperline supplies the
missing startup commands, including the stack-size helper. Keep `detach`
disabled on the A500 KS1.3 preset.

When stopped in a loaded program, use the graph button (**Profile**) for one
emulated frame or the pulse button (**Profile (Multi)**) to choose a frame
count. Copperline records source-mapped instruction call stacks and opens the
resulting `.cpuprofile` in VS Code. Profiles separate each function's CPU work
from a `[Bus wait]` child showing chip-DMA contention; register snapshots and
IRQ level/vector metadata remain in the capture directory returned by the
adapter. Kickstart and AROS call-stack frames, disassembly, and profiles are
named from the running guest's live library/device vectors (for example,
`[exec] AllocMem+$12` and `[Kick]exec/AllocMem`); no matching ROM ELF is
required.

A launch configuration with `"coverage": "${workspaceFolder}/lcov.info"` has
the emulator count every instruction the program retires from its first
instruction to its exit and write lcov line/function coverage to that file
when it exits or the session stops. **Copperline: Show Coverage** loads such a
file into VS Code's built-in Test Coverage view and editor decorations (it is
also the *Copperline Coverage* item's "Run with Coverage" in the Test
Explorer); the Coverage Gutters extension reads the same file.

The debug toolbar also opens Copperline's native Debugger, Console, and Frame
Analyzer windows. The Debug sidebar has a DAP-fed **Custom Registers** tree
whose tooltips come from Copperline's register documentation. From the command
palette, **Init Amiga Project** creates a C demo (system takeover, Copper,
blitter bob, VBL interrupt and uaelib helpers) with Bartman, bebbo, and
vbcc/vasm Makefile support plus six machine launch presets. **Convert EXE to
ADF** and **Profile File Size** expose the matching `copperline-ctl` tools.

The extension pack recommends `prb28.amiga-assembly` for Amiga assembly syntax,
documentation, and language tooling rather than duplicating those features.

To attach to an emulator you started yourself:

```sh
copperline --control-gui :0 --control-info /tmp/ccp.json --run hello
```

```json
{
  "type": "copperline",
  "request": "attach",
  "name": "Attach to Copperline",
  "controlInfo": "/tmp/ccp.json",
  "program": "${workspaceFolder}/hello"
}
```

## Building the extension

There is no build step. To package it:

```sh
cd tools/vscode-copperline
npx --yes @vscode/vsce package --no-dependencies --out copperline-debug.vsix
code --install-extension ./copperline-debug.vsix --force
```

Alternatively run **Extensions: Install from VSIX...** in VS Code and select
that file. Reload the window after replacing an already loaded extension.

The Bartman template includes its freestanding 68000 runtime operations
(`runtime.c`) because the extension's bundled compiler does not include
libc/libgcc archives. Its formatter entry point supports both ELF and hunk
symbol naming conventions.
