//! Generic USB gamepad support: bundled controller-database defaults with a
//! one-time guided calibration as the per-pad override.
//!
//! gilrs is built with its bundled SDL_GameControllerDB mappings (and the
//! SDL_GAMECONTROLLERCONFIG environment variable) enabled. A pad the
//! database or the platform driver recognises works out of the box through
//! a fixed standard layout: d-pad and left stick drive the directions,
//! South is fire/CD32 red, East blue, West green, North yellow, Start
//! play/pause, and the left/right shoulders and triggers are reverse and
//! forward. Select/Back and the guide button, which no emulated control
//! uses, open the menu; Select held is the Quit hotkey.
//!
//! A saved calibration always wins over the database. That keeps unknown
//! pads working and broken database entries fixable the same way (many
//! cheap "retro" pads have broken or missing SDL_GameControllerDB entries):
//! calibrate once, pushing each control when prompted. Calibration records
//! which raw axis/button event code drives each Amiga port-2 joystick
//! direction and button, keyed by controller UUID and persisted to a config
//! file. Because it records the actual input the user pushes for each
//! direction, it needs no axis-sign or axis-order assumptions -- inversion
//! and layout fall out automatically.
//!
//! Besides the emulated controls, calibration can optionally bind a Menu
//! button and a Quit hotkey. Neither reaches the emulated port: a press of
//! the Menu button opens the menu, and the window turns a sustained hold of
//! the Quit hotkey -- or of the Menu button, when no separate Quit control
//! was bound -- into an application exit.
