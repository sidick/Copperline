//! Host MIDI bridge for Paula's serial port (`[serial] mode = "midi"`).
//!
//! On output, each serial byte is stamped with the emulated colour clock it left
//! the wire on (see [`crate::serial::SerialTimeAnchor`]) and scheduled at the
//! matching host time, so the guest's byte timing survives to the host instead of
//! collapsing to the moment a frame's worth of bytes happens to be flushed. On
//! input, the backend fills a ring the receiver drains at the emulated baud rate.
//!
//! The input ring is a lock-free `ringbuf` SPSC queue (producer on the CoreMIDI
//! thread, consumer on the emulation thread). Paula's serial idle fast path polls
//! `has_pending_input` on nearly every device tick, so that poll must not lock.
//!
//! The emulator core only sees the [`SerialSink`]. The platform connection lives
//! behind [`MidiBackend`], chosen by `cfg(target_os)`: macOS drives CoreMIDI,
//! Linux the ALSA sequencer, and other targets get a stub until their backend
//! exists.
