//! The bundled HostSocket board (`[hostsocket]`): `bsdsocket.library` for
//! the guest, backed by an embedded smoltcp TCP/IP stack running on the
//! host instead of a real Amiga TCP/IP stack running inside the emulated
//! CPU. A guest application opens `bsdsocket.library` and calls
//! `socket()`/`connect()`/`send()`/`recv()` exactly as it would against
//! AmiTCP or Roadshow, with no guest-side stack to boot at all.
//!
//! The board is an ordinary WASM plugin board (crates/hostsocket-plugin,
//! hosted by `src/wasmboard.rs`) whose module and guest autoboot ROM are
//! embedded in the binary rather than loaded from user-supplied files --
//! the same bundling trick as the AROS boot ROM ([`BUNDLED_AROS_ROM`]) and
//! the services handler ([`crate::filesys::FILESYS_HANDLER`]). Config
//! resolution turns `[hostsocket]` into a [`WasmBoardConfig`] carrying the
//! [`BUNDLED_HOSTSOCKET_WASM`] path sentinel, so the plugin host (and a
//! save-state reload, which reopens modules by path) resolves the embedded
//! bytes instead of touching the filesystem.
//!
