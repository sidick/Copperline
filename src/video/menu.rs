//! The pop-up menu's shape: what it offers, and what picking a row does.
//!
//! The menu is a tree. Its top level holds the tools and a handful of
//! categories; a category opens a child list beside it, and a setting with
//! more than two values opens a further list of those values with the current
//! one marked. Only the leaves do anything, which keeps the question "what
//! happens when this is chosen" answerable in one place ([`MenuAction`])
//! rather than spread across the drawing code.
//!
//! The tree is rebuilt each time the menu opens, from the machine as it
//! stands: a serial port with nothing on it contributes no rows, and neither
//! does a parallel port, so a category that would be empty is never offered.
