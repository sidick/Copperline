# Direct executable launching (`--run`)

The `--run` flag boots Copperline straight into an Amiga executable on the
host filesystem, with no disk image or Workbench installation to prepare. This
suits development with an Amiga cross-compiler toolchain:

```sh
copperline --run build/hello
copperline --run build/hello --run-args "-level 2"
copperline --run build/hello --run-stack 32768 --run-detach
```

Add `--window-scale 2` to open at twice the normal window width and height,
or `--maximized` for a maximized window that keeps its title bar and the
desktop taskbar visible. `--full-screen` opens borderless fullscreen.
These also work with `--config`; see [Configuration](configuration.md).

To turn an already linked hunk executable into a standard 880 KiB floppy, use
`copperline-ctl exe2adf PROG --boot [--out FILE]` (by default the output is
`PROG` with its extension changed to `.adf`). It writes the executable and an
`S/Startup-Sequence` that runs it, using the same OFS directory-tree writer as
Copperline's virtual filesystems; `--boot` installs the AmigaDOS boot
block. Omit `--boot` for a mountable data disk. The executable's filename must
be 1-30 Latin-1 characters and cannot contain `:` or `/`; the generated script
uses the same single-byte name stored in the disk directory.

## How it works

When `--run` is used, Copperline mounts two host directories as live AmigaDOS
volumes:

1. **`RunBoot:`** (boot priority 6) -- A generated boot volume containing an
   `S/Startup-Sequence` that sets the current directory, launches the
   executable, and writes a completion marker holding the program's AmigaDOS
   return code when it exits. Copperline stages it in `run/boot-<pid>/` under
   the Copperline host data folder and regenerates it on every launch.
   Bundled `C:FailAt`, `C:CD`, `C:Stack`, `C:Echo`, and `C:Done` executables
   supply the commands missing from a bare Kickstart 1.3 ROM (`Done` writes
   the return code the CLI keeps in `cli_ReturnCode`); `C:Execute` supplies
   the detached script handoff on later ROMs. No Workbench command files are
   needed.
2. **`RunProg:`** (read/write) -- The host directory containing the executable.
   The guest loads the binary directly from this volume, and any files the
   program writes land in the same host directory.

`--run-args STRING` appends arguments to the program's command line.
`--run-stack BYTES` accepts 2048 through 2147483644 bytes and issues an
AmigaDOS `Stack` command before the executable; invalid sizes are rejected
before booting. `--run-detach` launches the program through
`Run >NIL: <NIL:` and closes the boot CLI (Kickstart 2.0+ or AROS).

Unlike [WHDLoad](whdload.md), `--run` derives nothing: the machine is whatever
the configuration and CLI flags describe, which by default is an A500 with the
bundled AROS Kickstart replacement. Choose another machine as usual:

```sh
copperline --model A1200 --fast 8M KICK31.ROM --run build/demo
```

(exit-on-return)=
## Guest exit status (`--exit-on-return`)

With `--exit-on-return` (which requires `--run`), the session ends the
moment the program's return code lands in the completion marker, and
Copperline's own exit status is that code (clamped to 0-255). Like
`--coverage`, the flag on its own makes a headless run: no window,
unthrottled, and no capture flag needed to end it. Only with
`--control-gui` or `--gdb-gui` does the session stay windowed, and the
window then closes when the program returns. `--gdb` and `--control`, which
own the run loop themselves, refuse the flag.

```sh
copperline --run build/tests --exit-on-return --noaudio; echo $?
```

If the run ends for another reason before the program returns (the last
`--screenshot-after` fired, or the window was closed), the status is 4. A
program that never returns therefore needs a bounding flag such as
`--screenshot-after 60 /tmp/end.png` to turn into a 4 rather than an
endless run. The generated script sets `FailAt 2147483647` so no return code
aborts it before the marker is written. A non-zero code takes precedence
over a failed `--expect-screenshot` (status 3); a zero one does not hide it.
The full status table is in [Headless](headless.md#exit-statuses).
`guest/run-tools/retcode` returns the number given as its argument, for
checking the plumbing end to end.

## Fast-forward boot (Warp mode)

In interactive windowed sessions, `--run` automatically enables warp mode during boot.
(For configurations booting from media rather than `--run`, warp boot is also available via
`--warp-boot` / `--warp-until`; see [Configuration](configuration.md).)
The emulator runs unthrottled with audio muted until the guest OS loads the
executable (detected at its `LoadSeg`, before its first instruction runs).
Emulation and audio then return to real time.

Additional operational notes:

- **Early termination:** A program that runs to completion before the
  per-frame check sees it load still ends warp mode, through the completion
  marker the `Startup-Sequence` writes.
- **Boot timeouts:** If the program has not loaded within 60 emulated seconds (for
  example, because the OS crashed during initialization), warp mode disengages so the
  system state can be inspected.
- **File naming:** Executable names must use printable ASCII characters without quotes (`"`),
  colons (`:`), or slashes (`/`). Spaces in executable names are supported and quoted automatically.
- **Manual override:** Pressing the warp toggle shortcut (`Cmd+W` / `Alt+W`) cancels
  the automatic warp phase and every programmatic warp hold at once, returning
  to real-time execution.
- **Programmatic warp:** A control-protocol client (`warp.set {"on": true}`, see
  [Control Protocol](../debugger/control.md)), a GDB client (`monitor warp on`,
  see [GDB](../debugger/gdb.md)), and the guest program itself (`warpmode(1)` /
  `warpmode(0)` through the [uaelib trap](#uaelib-trap) below, e.g. during heavy
  computation or asset loading) each hold warp independently. All mute live
  audio while engaged; `warp.set {"on": false}`, `monitor warp off`, or
  `warpmode(0)` release only that holder, real time returns when the last hold
  goes, and the shortcut returns to real time regardless.
- **Physical floppy drives:** With a [physical floppy drive](fluxbridge.md)
  attached, the machine stays paced to the real drive, so there is no warp.
- **Headless mode:** Headless capture runs (`--screenshot-after`, `--dump-frames`) run
  unthrottled anyway and work with `--run`.

## Debugging

When launched with `--gdb`, Copperline halts execution at the entry point of the loaded
program before the first instruction runs:

```sh
copperline --run build/hello --gdb :2345
m68k-amiga-elf-gdb hello.elf -ex "target remote :2345" -ex continue
```

When halted, the GDB stub reports the base address of the first hunk for symbol loading
via `add-symbol-file`. The GDB monitor command `monitor segments` lists all hunk addresses;
`monitor return-to-program` runs out of the Kickstart ROM window after an OS call.

The [control protocol](../debugger/control.md) gets the same break-at-entry: with
`--run`, `--control` and `--control-gui` arm a one-shot `loadseg` stop for the
program, and `segments.list` reports its hunk addresses at that stop. Scripts can
also arm their own `loadseg` breakpoint to catch every load.

For an IDE, the [Debug Adapter Protocol](../debugger/dap.md) server does all of
this by itself: a VS Code (or nvim-dap) launch configuration naming the program
starts Copperline, stops at the entry point, and debugs by source line from the
executable's own debug information.

`--coverage FILE` turns the same load-to-exit window into lcov line and
function coverage of the program, written when it exits or the run ends; see
[Guest code coverage](../debugger/profiling.md#guest-coverage).

(uaelib-trap)=
### WinUAE-compatible `uaelib` trap

WinUAE's boot ROM provides guest programs with a lightweight service interface,
the "uaelib" trap at `$F0FF60`. Cross-compiler toolchains and templates (such
as `vscode-amiga-debug`) use this trap for helpers like `warpmode()`, `KPrintF()`,
and `debug_register_*()`. Copperline implements the same ABI at the same address,
so code written for that template works unmodified.

Guest code checks the instruction word at `$F0FF60` (`0x4EB9` for a `JSR`, or
WinUAE's A-line `0xA00E`) and invokes the address as a C function, passing the
function index as the first stack parameter and receiving the return value in D0:

```c
long (*UaeConf)(long fn, int index, const char *param, int len, char *out, int outlen)
    = (long (*)(long, int, const char *, int, char *, int))0xf0ff60;
if (*(UWORD *)UaeConf == 0x4eb9 || *(UWORD *)UaeConf == 0xa00e) {
    char out;
    UaeConf(82, -1, "warp true", 0, &out, 1);   /* warpmode(1) */
}
```

| Function | WinUAE meaning | Copperline |
|---|---|---|
| 13 | `ExitEmu`: quit the emulator | Ends the session cleanly at the next frame boundary: the window closes, a headless run stops, and the process exits with status 0 (or 3 if a screenshot expectation had failed). No arguments; returns 1. `guest/uaelib-test/exitemu` calls it. |
| 82 | `uae-configuration`-style `"key value"` line | `warp true` / `warp false` (also `yes` / `no`) toggles warp mode. Parameters like `cpu_speed` and `*_cycle_exact` are accepted as no-ops. Returns 0. |
| 86 | Debug log string | Printed to the host console as `DBG: <text>` (shared with serial output), streamed to control-protocol `debug` subscribers as `event.debug`, and mirrored into the debugger console. Returns 1. |
| 88 | `debug_cmd` multiplexer | `debug_register_bitmap` / `_palette` / `_copperlist` and `debug_unregister` register guest assets, viewable in the Frame Analyzer (Resources and Memory tabs), exportable as PNG there or with `debug.resource.export`, searchable via `palette.dump` / `copper.list`, and listed with the console `DBGRES` command; `debug_start_idle` / `debug_stop_idle` report guest idle time in `debug.idle` and `event.frame.guest_idle_cck`. Overlay drawing (`debug_clear` / `debug_rect` / `debug_filled_rect` / `debug_text` on a 768x576 virtual canvas) renders on screen in the window (excluded from captures and recordings). `debug_load` / `debug_save` are disabled by default; see below. |
| others | version, disks, RTG, ... | Return 0 with no side effects. |

- Enabled by default; set `[emulation] uaelib = false` to leave `$F0FF60` unmapped.
- Set `[emulation] uaelib_files = true` to let `debug_load(address, name)` and
  `debug_save(address, size, name)` access the host. Paths are confined below
  the `--run` program directory: absolute paths, `..`, symlink escapes, invalid
  UTF-8, unmapped guest-memory ranges, and transfers over 16 MiB are rejected.
  `debug_load` returns the byte count, or 0 when disabled or rejected. This is
  an explicit trust decision for the launched guest and has no effect without
  a `--run` program directory.
- A CDTV extended ROM occupies `$F00000` and covers this address space.
- Without the trap, `KPrintF` falls back to Exec `RawPutChar` and emits over the serial port.
- Guest-initiated warp mutes live audio; `warpmode(0)` releases the guest's hold, and `Cmd+W` / `Alt+W` ends every hold.
- The return latch is shared: uaelib calls from interrupt handlers between a main-thread doorbell write and result read may overwrite D0.

(winuae-debug-port)=
### Memory-mapped debug output

Copperline also accepts WinUAE's printf-style memory writes. Write each argument
to `$BFFF00`, in order, then write a pointer to a NUL-terminated format string to
`$BFFF04`. The format write prints one message and clears the argument queue.
It uses the same `DBG:` output as `KPrintF`: the host terminal, debugger console,
and control-protocol `debug` subscribers.

```c
volatile ULONG *debugArgument = (volatile ULONG *)0xbfff00;
volatile ULONG *debugFormat = (volatile ULONG *)0xbfff04;
static const char valueFormat[] = "value = %ld (0x%08lx)\n";

*debugArgument = (ULONG)value;
*debugArgument = (ULONG)value;
*debugFormat = (ULONG)valueFormat;
```

The repeated value supplies two arguments, one for each conversion. Use
`volatile` pointers so the compiler preserves all writes and their order.
This interface needs no guest library or operating-system call, so it also
works in code that has taken over the machine.

| Conversion | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `%d`, `%i`, `%u` | Signed or unsigned 16-bit integer; `l` selects 32 bits (`%ld`, `%lu`). |
| `%x`, `%X`, `%o` | Hexadecimal or octal 16-bit integer; `l` selects 32 bits. |
| `%p` | 32-bit address as `$` followed by eight lowercase hex digits. |
| `%c` | Low byte as a character. |
| `%s` | Pointer to a NUL-terminated string. |
| `%b` | Pointer to a length-prefixed Amiga BSTR (a byte address, not a BPTR). |
| `%%` | Literal percent sign; consumes no argument. |

Numeric widths, precision, and the `-`, `+`, space, `#`, and `0` flags are
supported; `%08lx` prints a zero-padded longword. String widths and precision
are supported too. Pointer width and `-` alignment add spaces around the full
`$` prefix and eight hex digits; pointer precision does not shorten them.
Floating point, `*` widths, `%n`, and WinUAE's custom
`%[CYCLES]` conversion are unsupported; unsupported conversions remain literal.

Argument writes can be bytes, words, or longwords. Format pointers must be
longwords; paired word transfers within a 68000 or 68010 instruction are
assembled automatically in either order, including predecrement `MOVEM.L`.
Separate word-store instructions remain separate arguments. Up to 32 arguments
and 4096 bytes of format/output are accepted.
Extra arguments are ignored, missing ones print `<missing>`, and unreadable
string arguments print `<invalid>`. An unreadable format pointer clears the
queue without printing. Strings are read only from guest RAM or ROM, without
accessing hardware registers.

The ports are enabled by default with `[emulation] uaelib = true`; setting it
to `false` disables them along with the trap. The ports also work on CDTV,
where an extended ROM can cover the separate `$F0FF60` trap. Pending arguments
are preserved in save states and rewind, and cleared by a machine reset.
The queue is shared, so an interrupt handler must not interleave another
message's writes.

## Kickstart compatibility

Normal `--run` launches support bare Kickstart 1.3, later ROMs, and bundled
AROS. The generated boot volume supplies small GPL-licensed 68000 versions of
`FailAt`, `CD`, `Stack`, `Echo`, and `Done` for the 1.x CLI. Working-directory
changes, arguments, `--run-stack`, and the completion marker with its return
code work without Workbench.
The program itself must also use APIs available on the selected ROM.

`--run-detach` still requires Kickstart 2.0+ or AROS: the bundle does not
replace the `Run` and `EndCLI` commands used by detached launches. The bundled
`Execute` handles the generated child script without parameter substitution
or nested scripts.
Kickstart 1.2 lacks filesystem autoconfig support and cannot boot the
host-directory volumes, even though the bundled commands use 1.x APIs.
