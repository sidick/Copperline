//! Zorro expansion bus: an ordered autoconfig chain of boards.
//!
//! Boards appear one at a time in the Zorro II configuration space at
//! $E80000 (the A1200/A600/A500 path; this emulator has no native Zorro III
//! backplane, so Zorro III boards configure through the same window, as
//! expansion.library does on real 32-bit machines). Each board exposes the
//! nibble-encoded autoconfig ROM until the system ROM either assigns it a base
//! address or shuts it up, at which point the next unconfigured board
//! appears.
//!
//! Boards are described by a [`BoardSpec`]; built-in RAM boards come from
//! `[memory] fast`/`z3` in the config, and additional boards can be loaded
//! from TOML metadata files via `[[zorro]]` sections (the "plugin" path:
//! the autoconfig identity lives in data, not code). RAM-backed storage and
//! functional device apertures share the same placement and dispatch path
//! through [`BoardBacking`].
