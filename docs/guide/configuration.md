# Configuration reference

Copperline is configured by a TOML file: the file passed with `--config`,
else `./copperline.toml` if present, else the configuration saved with the
configuration screen's **Save default** button (see [](ui.md)). Every field
is optional; missing fields use the defaults documented here.
`copperline.example.toml` in the repository root is a commented companion to
this reference.

`--factory` ignores the saved default and starts from Copperline's own
settings; `--config` and `./copperline.toml` always win over it anyway. With
no default saved, the flag changes nothing.

Configuration parsing rejects unknown keys, invalid CPU or chipset names,
and out-of-range sizes. Media are opened during startup; depending on the
device, an unavailable image either stops startup or leaves the unit absent
with a warning in the log.

## Paths on Windows

This applies to every path field below (`rom`, disk images, hard-drive
files, the SCSI ROMs, and so on). In a TOML double-quoted string the
backslash is an escape character, so a Windows path written the obvious way
(`rom = "C:\Kickstarts\KICK31.ROM"`) is rejected: `\K` is not a valid escape.
Use any one of:

```toml
rom = 'C:\Kickstarts\KICK31.ROM'    # single quotes: a literal string, no escaping
rom = "C:\\Kickstarts\\KICK31.ROM"  # double quotes: backslashes doubled
rom = "C:/Kickstarts/KICK31.ROM"    # forward slashes also work on Windows
```

Single-quoted literal strings are the least error-prone. macOS and Linux paths
use forward slashes and need none of this. TOML paths do not expand `~` or
shell variables; use an absolute path or a path relative to the working directory.

## Command-line overrides

The most common machine knobs can be set on the command line without writing
a config file. These flags layer on top of the config file (or, when there is
none, the built-in defaults) and are validated by exactly the same parsers and
range checks as the equivalent TOML fields:

For example, to boot a stock A1200 profile but with 8 MB of fast RAM and a
faster CPU, with no config file at all:

```sh
./target/release/copperline --model A1200 --fast 8M --cpu-clock 28 KICK31.ROM
```

A `--model` profile supplies the chipset, CPU, and memory defaults of a real
machine; the other flags then override individual values on top of it, just as
explicit `[cpu]`/`[chipset]`/`[memory]` sections override a `[machine]`
profile in a config file.

The audio, serial, parallel, and network surface has matching per-run flags
too -- `--audio-device`, `--audio-channel-mode`, `--audio-filter`,
`--audio-stereo-separation`, `--serial`, `--midi-in`, `--midi-out`,
`--mt32-control-rom`, `--mt32-pcm-rom`, `--mt32-panel`, `--parallel`,
`--sampler-audio-input`, `--sampler-input-gain`, `--a2065-net`,
`--a2065-interface`, `--hostsocket-net`, `--hostsocket-interface` --
described with their `[audio]`, `[serial]`, `[parallel]`, `[a2065]`, and
`[hostsocket]` keys below.

## Top level

```toml
rom = "KICK13.ROM"            # Kickstart image, 512 KiB (or a 256 KiB 1.x part)
extended_rom = "cd32ext.rom"  # optional: CDTV (256K at $F00000) or
                              # CD32 (512K at $E00000) extended ROM
# fmv = true                  # CD32: fit the FMV module (bundled open ROM)
# fmv_rom = "another.rom"     # CD32: fit the FMV module with this ROM
# identify = false            # drop the Copperline identification board
                              # from the Zorro chain (default: present)
```

`identify` controls a small, inert Zorro autoconfig board Copperline puts on
the expansion chain (manufacturer 5192 / product 2) so guest software such
as [identify.library](https://github.com/shred/identify) can detect that it
is running under the emulator. It is on by default and does not change the
machine's usable memory; set `identify = false` for a chain with no
emulator-identifying board. See [](../zorro) for details.

The ROM path can be overridden by a positional CLI argument. Omit `rom`
entirely (and pass no ROM argument) to boot the bundled AROS open-source
Kickstart replacement, which ships with Copperline as the default boot ROM;
its main and extended halves are located next to the binary (under
`share/copperline/aros` for a Homebrew install) or set
`COPPERLINE_AROS_DIR`. You can also fit a different ROM at runtime from the
menu's **Load Kickstart ROM...** item, which hard-resets the machine. Machine
profiles that need an extended ROM (CDTV, CD32) will tell you if it is
missing.

The Kickstart and extended-ROM keys accept images in either byte order.
Alongside plain CPU-order
dumps, the byte-swapped images prepared for EPROM programmers -- the
single-chip `.bin` ROM files in Hyperion's Kickstart 3.1.4/3.2 releases, such
as `kick.a500a600a2000.46.143.bin`, store every 16-bit word with its bytes
exchanged -- are recognised from their header and restored on load, so either
file boots identically. A 256 KiB Kickstart 1.x part is mirrored across the
512 KiB ROM window, as it decodes on real hardware. The split `hi`/`lo` chip
pairs for the 32-bit machines are not accepted; use the matching single-file
image instead.

`fmv = true` fits the CD32 Full Motion Video module with Copperline's bundled
open-source 256 KiB replacement ROM, and `fmv_rom = "path"` fits it with a
custom image (such as the Commodore v40.30 ROM) instead; both are valid only
with the `CD32` machine profile. The cartridge slot is empty by default: a
stock CD32 has no module, and fitting one changes the guest's memory layout
and boot timing enough to alter titles that never used it (`fmv_rom = ""`, the
older spelling of an empty slot, is still accepted). The module autoconfigures
ahead of the standard Zorro chain, driving the CL450 video and L64111 MPEG
Layer II audio decoders through guest code. The launcher's **ROM** tab exposes
this setting as **FMV module ROM**.

The open ROM includes a clean-room `cd32mpeg.device` and `videocd.library` compatible
with CD32 Kickstart 3.1. The library identifies inserted Video CDs and parses their
metadata. Under CD32 Kickstart, the bundled version 41 `cdstrap` autoboots Video CDs
into a track menu: navigate with Up/Down, press Red to play, and press Blue to stop
or exit. Standard CD32 game discs pass through to the default boot sequence. Bundled
AROS includes its own MPEG device and CDXL playback support, but bypasses
cartridge diagnostics, so the
cartridge library and player are currently Kickstart-specific. Neither path requires
proprietary Commodore code or CL450 microcode, as Copperline models the CL450
command interface at the host level.

Copperline also names the ROM it is given. A ROM file's name is whatever its
dumper called it, so the image is identified by checksum against a table of
the released Amiga boot ROMs -- every Kickstart from 1.0 to 3.2.3, the CD32
Kickstart and extended ROM, the CDTV/A570 extended ROMs and the A1000
bootstrap -- and the version is reported as, for example,
`Kickstart 3.1 (40.68) A1200`. Identification survives the same forms the
loader accepts (byte-swapped dumps, a 256 KiB part stored doubled), and an
Amiga Forever image still in its `AMIROMTYPE1` container is reported as
encrypted rather than unknown. The identification appears in the start-up
`config:` log line, in the About window's `ROM:` line, in the OSD when a ROM
is fitted from the menu, and under each path row of the machine-configuration
screen's ROM tab. The bundled AROS ROM reports itself as `bundled AROS`; any
other image the table does not carry -- DiagROM, a ROM you built yourself --
simply goes unnamed and boots as usual.

## `[paths]` -- where files go

```toml
[paths]
# base = "/somewhere/else"   # move the whole tree; the rest are under it
# states = "states"          # save states, incl. the quick-save slots
# screenshots = "screenshots"
# recordings = "recordings"  # video captures, GIF clips and recorded input scripts
# nvram = "nvram"            # battery-backed RAMs, incl. CD32 game saves
# traces = "traces"          # debugger traces and waveform captures
# configs = "configs"        # configurations saved from the launcher
# roms = "roms"              # the rest set where an empty file dialog opens:
# mt32_roms = "roms/mt32"    # MT-32 control and PCM ROMs
# floppies = "floppies"
# harddrives = "harddrives"
# cds = "cds"
```

Specifies where Copperline writes output files and where file dialogs open
when no path is set. Every key is optional and falls back to the default
directory structure under the host data path (`~/Documents/Copperline` on macOS
and Linux, `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Copperline` on Windows, or the application
folder in a [portable installation](ui.md#where-files-go)).

Relative paths are resolved against `base` (which itself defaults to the host
data directory), while absolute paths are used directly. Output folders are
created automatically on first write. Dialog folders are not created
automatically and only open in existing directories.

These name folders on the machine that runs the configuration, so a config
copied to another machine may name folders that are not there. At startup
each entry set here is checked and one that cannot be found is ignored with
a warning in the log, falling back to its default -- the check waits no
more than a moment, so a dead network mount delays starting rather than
preventing it. Explicit output paths on the command line
(`--screenshot-after`, `--save-state-after`, and so on) are used exactly as
written and never consult this section.

## `[machine]` -- machine profiles

```toml
[machine]
profile = "A1200" # A1000, A500, A500OCS, A500Plus (A500+), A600, A1200, A3000, A4000, CDTV, CD32
rtc = true        # add a battery RTC (default: only A500+/CDTV/A3000/A4000 ship with one)
# rtc_chip = "RP5C01"              # MSM6242 (default) or RP5C01 (A3000/A4000 default)
# rtc_time = "2005-03-18 01:58:29" # seed the clock; it then ticks in emulated time
# rtc_frozen = true                # stop the seeded clock at rtc_time exactly
# battmem = "battmem.nvram"        # RP5C01 battery-RAM backing file (default when fitted)
mem_controller = "ramsey-07" # none, ramsey-04 (A3000), ramsey-07 (A4000)
rom_scsi_device_disable = true # skip the ROM's scsi.device (default: when its bus has no drives)
```

A machine profile bundles the chipset, CPU, memory, gate array, and
peripheral defaults of a real machine. The key is `profile` (the deprecated
`model` alias still parses) so it never collides with `[cpu] model`. Explicit `[cpu]`, `[chipset]`, and
`[memory]` sections override individual profile defaults. Without a
`[machine]` section you get the A500 Rev 6A default (the same as the `A500`
profile: ECS 8372A Agnus, OCS 8362 Denise, 68000, 512K chip RAM, 512K
trapdoor slow RAM) -- the most common and most-targeted Amiga. An explicit
`[chipset] revision` overrides the per-machine chips, so `revision = "OCS"`
gives a plain 8371/8362 OCS machine.

| Profile | Chipset | CPU | Chip RAM | Slow RAM | Extras |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `A1000` | OCS (8361/8367 Agnus, OCS Denise) | 68000 @ 7.09 MHz | 256K | 0 | WCS, boot ROM + Kickstart disk |

| `A4000` | AGA (Alice/Lisa) | 68040 @ 25 MHz | 2M | 0 | Ramsey-07, RP5C01 RTC |
| `CDTV` | ECS | 68000 @ 7.09 MHz | 1M | 0 | DMAC CD controller, RTC, 256K extended ROM, no floppy drive |
| `CD32` | AGA (Alice/Lisa) | 68EC020 @ 14.18 MHz | 2M | 0 | Akiko, CD32 pad, NVRAM, 512K extended ROM, no floppy drive |

`rtc` exists because most Amigas shipped without a battery-backed clock and
only some carried one. The `A500Plus` (an OKI RTC soldered to the Rev 8A
board), `CDTV`, `A3000`, and `A4000` fit one by default; the base
A500/A500OCS, A600, A1200, A1000, and CD32 have none. Set `rtc = true` to add
one -- for an A600HD or a clock-equipped A1200, say -- so the Workbench clock
keeps time.

`rtc_chip` names the part in that socket, because Commodore used two with
different register protocols: the OKI **MSM6242** on the small boxes, the
CDTV, and the aftermarket clock expansions, and the Ricoh **RP5C01** on the
A3000/A4000 motherboards (the Ricoh also carries 26 nibbles of battery RAM,
which AmigaOS uses via `battmem.resource` on those machines). The default
follows the profile -- `RP5C01` on `A3000`/`A4000`, `MSM6242` everywhere else
-- and setting the key implies `rtc = true`. AmigaOS probes for either part,
so the choice is mostly invisible to it, but Linux/m68k does not probe: it
drives the chip the machine model dictates, so an A3000/A4000 booting Linux
needs the RP5C01 answering for its clock to work.

`battmem` persists the RP5C01's battery-backed registers -- the 26 RAM
nibbles behind `battmem.resource` plus the alarm and 12/24 settings --
across runs, the way the real board's battery does. This is where
`scsi.device` keeps its per-unit SCSI host settings (an A3000's or A4091's
synchronous-transfer, disconnect, and last-drive options, including
remembering attached CD-ROM drives), so without it those revert every run.
The file uses the same `.nvram` layout as WinUAE and Amiberry, so backing
files interchange between emulators; only the battery payload loads back --
the time-of-save digits in the file never override the (host- or
`rtc_time`-driven) clock. It defaults to `battmem.nvram` in the working
directory whenever an RP5C01 is fitted; point it elsewhere with a path, or
set `battmem = ""` to keep the battery registers session-only. Note that a
persisted file carries guest-visible state from one run into the next by
design, so delete it (or disable it) where byte-for-byte reproducible
headless runs matter.

`rtc_time` seeds the clock instead of letting it mirror the host's: the value
is either an integer (Unix seconds, UTC) or a string
`"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM[:SS]"` giving exactly the wall-clock time the guest reads
at power-on. A seeded clock ticks with *emulated* time, so the time the guest
sees is deterministic and reproducible byte-for-byte across runs -- the way
to test time-dependent guest software (TOTP/RFC 6238 vectors, timestamped
logs, date rollovers) or just to boot into a fixed date. Setting a time
implies `rtc = true`; combining it with an explicit `rtc = false` is an
error. `rtc_frozen = true` additionally stops the tick so every read returns
`rtc_time` exactly. Both are also available as `--rtc-time` / `--rtc-frozen`
CLI flags, and a control-protocol session can inspect and move the clock live
with `rtc.get` / `rtc.set` (see `docs/debugger/control.md`).

Two guest-side notes: Kickstart 2.0+ loads the system time from the battery
clock automatically at boot, while Kickstart 1.3 only does so when the
startup-sequence runs `SetClock LOAD`; and the chip's two-digit year registers
mean AmigaOS applies its usual century window, so seeds outside 1978-2077
will not read back as the year you set. A host-initiated reset or power
cycle restarts the emulated timeline and therefore restarts a seeded clock
from `rtc_time`; a guest-initiated reboot (the 68000 `RESET` instruction)
leaves it ticking, like real battery-backed hardware.

The `A3000` and `A4000` profiles are the big-box machines. They carry a
Ramsey memory controller (`mem_controller`), which is what the two registers
at `$DE0003` and `$DE0043` answer as, and they carry Gary rather than Gayle
-- so no PCMCIA and no Gayle IDE.

- The **A3000** has its motherboard SCSI: a Super DMAC at `$DD0000` driving a
  WD33C93, which Kickstart's own `scsi.device` initialises at boot. Attach
  drives to it with `[scsi] controller = "a3000"` (the default controller on
  an A3000; see the `[scsi]` section below).
- The **A4000** has its motherboard IDE interface at `$DD2020`; attach drives
  with `[ide]`, exactly as on a Gayle machine.

`rom_scsi_device_disable` skips Kickstart's built-in disk driver. It defaults
on when the machine's own controller -- the IDE port of an A600, A1200, or
A4000, or the A3000's SCSI -- has no drives configured: with nothing to boot,
the driver only costs startup time probing an empty bus. Configuring a drive
turns the driver back on automatically (it is the boot path for those
drives), and setting the flag explicitly wins in either direction. The ROM
file itself is never modified.

Both profiles fit their stock 4M of Ramsey-controlled motherboard fast RAM;
`[memory] motherboard` resizes it up to 16M, and on the A4000 up to 64M
via the motherboard RAM expansion space (see the `[memory]` section).
`[memory] accelerator` adds CPU-slot RAM at `$08000000` on any 32-bit
machine.

`mem_controller` is normally left to the profile. It is broken out because
Ramsey's registers collide with nothing else, so it can be fitted to
a wedge machine to exercise diagnostic tools that expect one.

The `A1000` profile models the original Amiga, which has no Kickstart ROM.
Its `rom` is instead the 64K bootstrap ROM ("Amiga ROM Bootstrap"); on
power-up the bootstrap loads Kickstart from the Kickstart disk in DF0 into
256K of writable control store (WCS) at `$FC0000`, write-protects it, and runs
it -- exactly as the real machine does. So an A1000 config names the bootstrap
ROM as `rom` and puts the Kickstart disk in `[floppy.df0]`; leave it in and the
machine boots to Kickstart (which then asks for a Workbench disk). See the
ready-made `a1000.example.toml`.

The `A500` profile models the common Rev 6A board: the ECS "Fatter" 8372A
Agnus (a 1 MiB chip-RAM reach and the software-selectable PAL/NTSC switch via
`BEAMCON0`) paired with the original OCS 8362 Denise. It is therefore an
Agnus-only ECS upgrade, not a full-ECS machine -- the OCS Denise means no
superhires or `BRDRBLNK`, exactly as on the real board. Chip RAM defaults to
the stock 512K but accepts up to 1M (`[memory] chip = "1M"`); more than 1M is
rejected because the 8372A cannot address it. Booting with no `[machine]`
section uses the same Rev 6A defaults; select `A500OCS` or set
`[chipset] revision = "OCS"` for the older 8371/8362 machine.

## `[emulation]`

```toml
[emulation]
power_on = true            # false = start powered off at the test screen
auto_launch = false        # true = the launcher runs this file at once
pacing_budget = "cycles"   # "cycles" (hardware-accurate) or "instructions"
realtime_priority = false  # true = raise the pacer/audio thread priority
warp_speed = "max"         # turbo limit: "2x", "4x", "8x", "16x", or "max"
warp_boot = false          # warp the boot until storage goes idle
warp_boot_idle = 10        # ...for this many emulated seconds
# warp_until = 12.0        # or warp until an absolute emulated time
uaelib = true              # WinUAE-compatible uaelib trap at $F0FF60
uaelib_files = false       # opt-in file helpers, below the --run directory
rewind = false             # true = record rewind history from power-on
rewind_budget_mb = 256     # host memory the rewind history may hold
rewind_interval_frames = 25 # emulated frames per rewind step
run_ahead_frames = 0       # run-ahead input-latency reduction, 0..4 (0 = off)
```

The deterministic cycle-driven core is the only emulation timing. It is
paced to wall-clock for the interactive window and runs unthrottled for
headless captures; the emulated result is identical. (An older `speed` key
here is accepted but ignored -- "real" was the only timing model, so it
carried no information.)

- `power_on = false` starts the machine powered off showing a test screen
  until you click the status-bar power button -- useful for arming video
  capture first. The power button cold-boots (reinitialising RAM according to
  `[memory] init`).
- `auto_launch = true` causes the launcher to immediately run this
  configuration upon opening. When set in the default configuration,
  Copperline boots directly into the machine without showing the configuration
  screen. The launcher's **A/V & Emu -> Emulation -> Run on startup** row
  controls this setting. Command-line launches are unaffected.
- `pacing_budget` selects how real-time pacing budgets CPU work per frame:
  `"cycles"` (default) charges each instruction its actual 68000 cycle cost
  plus chip-bus waits, matching real hardware speed; `"instructions"` uses a
  flat `COPPERLINE_REAL_CPU_CPI` (default 4.0) cycles/instruction quota,
  which is cheaper but runs the CPU faster than hardware.
  `COPPERLINE_REAL_PACING_BUDGET` overrides this for one run. See
  [](../internals/timing) for the full rationale.
- `realtime_priority = true` asks the OS to schedule Copperline's two
  latency-critical threads -- the wall-clock pacer and the audio callback --
  above normal, which reduces frame stutter and audio glitches when the host
  is busy. It is best effort and off by default, and never fails the run:
  - **macOS** -- the pacer thread joins the `USER_INTERACTIVE` QoS class. The
    audio callback is left alone because Core Audio already runs it on a
    real-time thread (overriding that would only demote it).
  - **Windows** -- both threads are raised via `SetThreadPriority`; no
    privilege required.
  - **Linux/other Unix** -- raising priority needs privilege (an `rtprio`
    rlimit, `CAP_SYS_NICE`, or root). Without it the request is logged and
    declined, and the thread keeps normal scheduling.

  `COPPERLINE_REALTIME_PRIORITY` overrides this for one run; set it to
  `0`/`false`/`off` to force it off, or to any other value (or leave it empty)
  to force it on.
- `warp_speed` sets the default speed of Warp Speed (turbo) mode. With VSync
  enabled (the default), emulating one frame per presented frame would pin
  warp to the host monitor's refresh rate. This option is an output frame
  skip -- `"2x"`, `"4x"`, `"8x"`, `"16x"`, or `"max"` (default) -- so warp
  retires that many emulated frames per presented frame, making warp roughly
  the limit times the refresh rate (host CPU permitting). `"max"` runs flat
  out and still presents at vsync when enabled. With VSync off, presentation
  frequency depends on host throughput. Adjust it live from the **Warp Limit**
  menu item or `Cmd+Shift+W` / `Alt+Shift+W` (see [The window and its
  controls](ui.md)).
- `warp_boot = true` accelerates boot sequences: from power-on, the machine
  runs unthrottled in warp mode (with audio muted) until storage activity
  (floppy and hard disk) remains idle for `warp_boot_idle` emulated seconds
  (default 10), at which point normal real-time execution and audio resume.
  This allows media-rich environments like AmigaVision or standard Workbench
  to boot quickly to their menus. Set `warp_boot_idle` high enough to bridge
  expected pauses in disk access during boot (such as when SetPatch builds
  MMU tables across large memory configurations). CD audio playback does not
  count as storage activity, preventing background CD-DA tracks from stalling
  the warp phase. If storage never becomes idle, warp boot times out after
  600 emulated seconds.
  `warp_until = SECS` provides a deterministic alternative that runs in warp
  mode until a specified emulated timestamp. `warp_boot` and `warp_until` are
  mutually exclusive and cannot be combined with `--run` (which manages its own
  warp phase); `--warp-boot` and `--warp-until` set them from the
  command line. Toggling warp manually (`Cmd+W` / `Alt+W`) or sending
  `warp.set {"on": false}` over the control protocol cancels the warp phase
  immediately. Headless captures ignore warp boot settings since they run
  unthrottled by default. The launcher's **Warp boot** and **Warp boot idle**
  rows (*A/V & Emu*, *Emulation*) configure storage-idle mode, while a loaded
  `warp_until` setting appears as its own *Until Ns* option.
- `uaelib = true` (default) enables the WinUAE-compatible service trap at
  `$F0FF60`. Guest programs can use this interface to toggle warp mode (via
  `warpmode()` in the vscode-amiga-debug template), emit debug log messages,
  and register bitmaps, palettes, and copper lists with the debugger (see
  [](run)). Setting this to `false` leaves `$F0FF60` unmapped. On CDTV
  configurations, the extended ROM occupies `$F00000` and covers this space.
- `rewind = true` records rewind history from power-on, so `Cmd+Z` / `Alt+Z`
  and the **Rewind** menu item can step the whole machine backward through
  it. It rides the same deterministic snapshot ring as the debugger's reverse
  controls (see [](../debugger/reverse)) and is off by default because it is
  not free: `rewind_budget_mb` (default 256) of host memory holds the
  snapshots, and one whole-machine serialize happens every
  `rewind_interval_frames` (default 25, half a second of PAL). One rewind
  step goes back exactly one interval; oldest snapshots are evicted first, so
  how much emulated time the budget buys scales with the machine's RAM size.
  Turning the menu item off releases the retained snapshots. The same
  determinism preconditions as reverse debugging apply -- a real-time clock
  and host disk writes are not rolled back.
- `run_ahead_frames` reduces input latency in compatible windowed sessions.
  Each refresh commits one ordinary frame, snapshots the machine, executes
  the requested number of future frames, presents the last future image, and
  restores the snapshot. Audio, serial output, and control events come only
  from the committed frame; speculative output is discarded. The committed
  machine timeline is therefore unchanged. This costs one whole-machine
  snapshot per refresh and roughly `(run_ahead_frames + 1)`x realtime host
  performance, so start at 1 and raise it only while the performance overlay
  shows comfortable headroom. Large values also skip visible intermediate
  animation.

  Run-ahead stays inactive when a speculative frame could observe or change
  host state that the snapshot cannot restore. This includes warp and
  headless capture, RTG output, rewind/reverse debugging, debugger stops,
  injected faults, validation/SMC/heat-map/frame-analyzer observers,
  instruction or waveform traces, a connected control client, video recording, loaded
  save states, live serial or parallel devices, writable or physical floppy
  media, mounted CDs, hard-drive and host-directory storage, host networking
  or plugin boards, MHI decoding, and a live or persistent RTC/NVRAM. Offline
  WAV and stem capture are supported: speculative audio is discarded at the
  mixer before any sink receives it. The **Run Ahead** item under Emulation
  Settings adjusts the level live and reports the current blocking reason.
  `--run-ahead FRAMES` overrides the config for one run.

## `[cpu]`

```toml
[cpu]
model = "68000"     # 68000, 68010, 68EC020, 68020, 68030, 68040, 68060
clock_mhz = 14.0    # optional; defaults to the model's stock speed

#                   # interface, so not valid on a 68000). The full 68040's
#                   # and 68060's on-die FPUs are enabled by default.
# unimplemented = "trap"  # 68060 only: "trap" (faithful; the OS needs
#                   # 68060.library) or "native" (execute the removed
#                   # instructions directly)
# jit = true        # experimental: fast batch/trace-JIT CPU execution
#                   # (68020+; not cycle-exact)
```

- `model`: the 68010 models the vector base register, the format-stacking
  exception model, and DBcc loop mode; the 68EC020 is a 68020 instruction
  set with a 24-bit external address bus.
- `clock_mhz` defaults to the model's stock speed (68000/68010 ~7.09, 020 ~14,
  030/040 ~25, 060 50) and is modelled as a whole multiple of the colour clock
  (3.546895 MHz). Fast RAM and ROM run at the CPU clock; chip and slow RAM
  stay chip-bus bound, so overclocking speeds up only what a real
  accelerator would speed up.
- `icache`/`dcache` model the on-chip caches and default **on** for the
  silicon that has them (instruction cache on the 020/68EC020/030/040/060,
  data cache on the 030/040/060), matching real hardware where AmigaOS
  enables them via CACR. The cache is sized to the CPU: 256 bytes on the
  020/030, 4 KB on the 040, 8 KB on the 060. Set either to `false` to opt
  out.
- `unimplemented` (68060 only) picks what happens on the instructions the
  68060 dropped from silicon: MOVEP, CHK2/CMP2, CAS2, misaligned CAS,
  64-bit MUL/DIV, and most of the FPU beyond basic arithmetic
  (transcendentals, FMOVECR, packed decimal). `"trap"` (the default) is
  what the chip does - they raise the unimplemented-instruction exceptions
  and the OS-side `68060.library` emulates them, exactly as on a real
  CyberStorm or Blizzard board, so software using them needs that library
  installed. `"native"` executes them directly for systems without it.
  Kickstart 3.1 itself boots fine under `"trap"`. `fpu = false` on the
  68060 models the LC/EC060: FP instructions take the FPU-disabled
  exception (PCR.DFP), which an OS handler can also use to enable and
  restart. The 68060's superscalar dual-issue and branch cache are
  modelled and activate when system software enables them (PCR.ESS and
  CACR.EBC, which `68060.library` does at boot); until then the chip runs
  scalar, as on real silicon. This is not cosmetic: code that loops
  out of chip RAM otherwise contends with bitplane DMA on every instruction
  fetch and can run at roughly half speed, which is why an AGA demo's music or
  animation may pace correctly only with the cache modelled. The data cache
  caches expansion RAM/ROM only, since chip and slow RAM are DMA-visible and
  cache-inhibited as on real Amigas.
- `jit` (experimental, also `--jit`/`--no-jit`) runs the CPU through the
  m68k core's batch/trace-JIT path instead of the cycle-exact
  per-instruction model: hot code compiles to native traces and fast-RAM
  accesses run through a zero-cost direct-memory window. The machine
  behaves like an ideal accelerator running at `clock_mhz`: one
  instruction per CPU clock with zero-wait fast RAM and ROM, so a 50 MHz
  68040 delivers on the order of 50 MIPS (raise `clock_mhz` for more).
  Interrupts are recognized at batch boundaries, so chip-level races and
  cycle-counted effects no longer line up; leave it off for anything
  timing-sensitive (games, demos). Chip and slow RAM still arbitrate onto
  the shared chip bus in order, and the on-chip cache models stay active
  (as on a real accelerator, they are what lets chip-RAM-resident code
  run at CPU speed), so displays, blits, and device I/O work normally. Requires a 68020
  or later: the 68000/68010 share one bus with the chipset and their
  floating-bus and prefetch semantics need the precise core, so
  `jit = true` on those models logs a note and stays precise (the
  launcher greys the toggle). Known issue: the bundled AROS ROM's boot
  screen may stay grey under JIT on some 020+ configurations (the guest
  still runs; Kickstart ROMs are unaffected).

## `[memory]`

```toml
[memory]
chip = "512K"        # OCS max 512K; ECS/AGA max 2M
fast = "0"           # Zorro II fast RAM at $200000: 64K..8M board sizes
slow = "512K"        # A500 trapdoor RAM at $C00000: 0 or up to 512K
init = "zero"         # or "random[:SEED]" / "pattern:0x5555" for read testing
motherboard = "0"    # Ramsey motherboard RAM (A3000/A4000): up to 16M (A4000: 64M)
accelerator = "0"    # CPU-slot RAM at $08000000 (32-bit CPUs): up to 128M
z3   = "0"           # Zorro III RAM (needs a 32-bit CPU): 64K..1G, power of two
```

Sizes accept `K`/`KB`/`M`/`MB` (and `G`/`GB` for Zorro III) suffixes or
plain byte counts, and must be multiples of 4 KiB.

`init` controls cold power-on contents for writable system RAM. The default,
`"zero"`, preserves Copperline's normal compatibility behaviour. `"random"`
fills chip, slow, motherboard, accelerator, A1000 WCS, and RAM-backed Zorro
boards with deterministic pseudo-random bytes, which helps expose guest code
that reads memory before initialising it. The fixed default seed is identical
across hosts and repeated cold resets; `"random:SEED"` selects another decimal
or `0x` hexadecimal 64-bit seed for test matrices. `"pattern:WORD"` instead
repeats one decimal or `0x` hexadecimal 16-bit word in big-endian Amiga byte
order; for convenience a bare value such as `"0x5555"` means the same thing as
`"pattern:0x5555"`. The Machine Configuration screen exposes these as
**Power-on fill** and **Fill pattern** on its Memory page. Warm keyboard resets
still preserve RAM, and save-state restores reproduce the saved bytes exactly.

For a one-off developer run:

```sh
./target/release/copperline --ram-init random --config game.toml --noaudio \
  --screenshot-after 20 /tmp/game-random-ram.png
```

- **Chip RAM** is range-checked against the chipset: 512K on OCS, 2M on
  ECS/AGA (also bounded by the selected Agnus revision's address reach).
- **Fast RAM** is exposed as a Zorro II autoconfig board at `$200000`, so
  it must be a legal Zorro II board size: 64K, 128K, 256K, 512K, 1M, 2M,
  4M, or 8M. On the A600/A1200 more than 4M reaches the PCMCIA slot's
  common-memory window at `$600000` and disables the slot (see
  [`[pcmcia]`](#pcmcia-config)).
- **Slow RAM** ($C00000 "ranger" RAM) is arbitrated on the chip bus through
  Agnus exactly like chip RAM -- it is slow in the authentic way.
- **Motherboard RAM** is the 32-bit local memory Ramsey drives on the
  A3000/A4000: it ends at `$08000000` and grows downward (16M reaches
  `$07000000`), and Kickstart sizes it with its own probe -- no autoconfig
  involved. It needs a Ramsey (`[machine] mem_controller`, fitted by the
  A3000/A4000 profiles, which also fit their stock 4M of this RAM by
  default) and a 32-bit CPU, and must fill whole Ramsey banks: 1M-4M in
  1M steps, or 8M, 12M, 16M. On the A4000 (Ramsey-07), sizes beyond 16M
  keep growing downward into the `$04000000`-`$06FFFFFF` motherboard RAM
  expansion space, in 4M steps up to 64M (which reaches `$04000000`).
  Set `motherboard = "0"` to remove it.
- **Accelerator RAM** is CPU-slot local memory: it starts at `$08000000`
  and grows upward through the coprocessor-slot expansion space, up to
  128M (ending at `$10000000`, where Zorro III space begins). This is the
  RAM an accelerator/CPU board carries, so it needs a 32-bit CPU but no
  particular machine profile; any whole number of megabytes fits.
  Kickstart sizes it with its own probe, like the motherboard bank.
- **Z3 RAM** requires a 68020/68030/68040/68060 (a 24-bit bus cannot reach it);
  Kickstart assigns its base address, usually `$40000000`.

Additional expansion boards can be described with `[[zorro]]` metadata
files; see [](../zorro).

## `[chipset]`

```toml
[chipset]
revision = "OCS"   # OCS, ECS, or AGA preset
video = "PAL"      # PAL or NTSC
# agnus = "8372A"  # optional fine-grained override
# denise = "OCS"   # optional fine-grained override
```

`revision` is a preset; `agnus` and `denise` allow the mixed configurations
real machines shipped with (a late A500 with an ECS Agnus but OCS Denise,
for example):

- `agnus`: `OCS`/`8370`/`8371` (OCS), `8372`/`8372A` (ECS, 1M chip),
  `8375`/`8372B` (ECS, 2M chip), `8374`/`ALICE` (AGA).
- `denise`: `OCS`/`8362`, `ECS`/`8373`, `LISA`/`4203`.

The ECS preset picks an 8372A for up to 1M chip RAM and an 8375 above; the
A600 profile always uses the 8375 as the real machine did. The AGA preset
resolves to Alice and Lisa: 8 bitplanes, the 256-entry 25-bit palette with
BPLCON3 BANK/LOCT banking, HAM8, FMODE wide bitplane and sprite fetch
(DMA and manual sprites), SSCAN2/BSCAN2 scan doubling, 35 ns BPLCON3
SPRES output, BPLCON4, and CLXCON2. Remaining gaps are recorded in
[](../internals/chipset).

## `[display]`

```toml
[display]
overscan = "tv"       # "tv" (default) or "full"
tv_h_centre = 0       # TV picture centring in lo-res pixels, -16..16 (+ = right)
tv_v_centre = 0       # TV picture centring in scan lines, -8..8 (+ = down)
pixel_aspect = "tv"   # "tv" (default, 4:3 CRT) or "square" (exact 2x2 lo-res)
scaling = "smooth"    # "smooth" (default, aspect fit) or "integer" (whole multiples)
deinterlace = true    # motion-adaptive interlace weaving (default true)
phosphor = 0.0        # CRT persistence fraction, 0.0 (off) to 0.95
shader = "none"       # "none" (default), "scanlines", "mask", "crt", or a .wgsl file
shader_strength = 1.0 # how strongly the shader is mixed in, 0.0-1.0
tint = "none"         # "none" (default), "bw", "green", "amber", or "sepia"
menu_scale = "1x"     # size of the pop-up menu: "1x" (default) or "2x"
full_screen = false   # open fullscreen at start (default false)
status_bar = true     # show the status bar at start (default true)
vsync = true          # synchronise desktop presentation to vblank (default true)
hidpi_texture = true  # draw the presentation texture at device-pixel density (default true)
```

`vsync` controls desktop presentation. On uses strict FIFO vsync to prevent
tearing. Off requests unsynchronised presentation where the graphics backend
supports it; it may reduce latency but can tear. **Video Settings > VSync**
changes it live without restarting or changing normal emulation speed. The
choice carries into the configuration screen when saving a config. Headless
captures and the browser frontend are unaffected. Roughly 50 Hz PAL output
can still show an uneven cadence on fixed 60 Hz or 120 Hz displays: VSync
does not make those refresh rates match.

`hidpi_texture` decides the resolution of the texture the window is drawn
from. On (the default) it follows the display's device-pixel density, so a
200% (Retina) window is fed a 2x texture and every host row picks its own
woven scanline. Off keeps the texture at canvas resolution and leaves the
upscale to the GPU's scaler pass, a quarter of the per-frame texture
upload (and of the CPU copy, when a menu or overlay makes the frame
compose on the CPU) -- worth trying on a slow host that falls short of
real time in a high-density window. Integer scaling looks the same either
way (its whole-number blocks are point-sampled from the 1x texture); the
smooth fit selects rows at canvas resolution instead of the finer texture
grid, which fine interlaced detail can show. Captures are never affected.

The emulated framebuffer always carries the full overscan field Denise
produces. `"tv"` presents what the monitor's glass shows: the captured
aperture -- the standard window plus the symmetric overscan margin the
framebuffer captures on its right edge -- fills the whole 4:3 glass, the
way a real set's raster overscans its screen, so the picture (border
colour included) reaches every edge with no black bezel columns. The
live window and PNG screenshots / `--dump-frames` present the same
716x540 glass; PAL and NTSC scans share the one shape because both
apertures fill the same glass -- an NTSC scan's shorter crop (the
200-line standard window plus the same overscan margin) is scaled onto
the same output rows. `"full"` shows everything, which
is useful when debugging display alignment. `COPPERLINE_OVERSCAN=full|tv`
overrides this for a single run. In both modes the presentation geometry
holds steady across the blank frames a screen change produces: a frame
showing only border colour keeps the previous frame's aperture and
centring instead of snapping to the full framebuffer, so the picture does
not jump sideways at Kickstart screen changes.

`tv_h_centre` / `tv_v_centre` nudge where the TV presentation centres the
picture on the glass -- the H-CENTER/V-CENTER controls a real monitor
carried on its front. `tv_h_centre` is in lo-res pixels, positive moving
the picture right; `tv_v_centre` in scan lines, positive moving it down.
The default aperture centres the standard window, which leaves most of
the captured left overscan off-glass; software that leans its artwork
into that overscan (the CD32 boot logo's leading "A" serif, for example)
comes fully into view a few pixels of `tv_h_centre` later, exactly as it
did on a set whose picture sat a little right of centre. Glass the nudge
exposes beyond the captured raster is unscanned and shows black. The
knobs move the TV aperture, so `overscan = "full"` ignores them; captures
(screenshots, frame dumps) follow them like the live window. The menu's
*Screen Centring* rows (under Video Settings) step the same knobs live
without touching the config.

`pixel_aspect` selects how emulated scanlines map to host rows. The default
`"tv"` presents the field with the non-square pixel aspect of a 4:3 CRT:
the full overscan scan fills a 4:3 picture, so PAL lo-res pixels come out
slightly wider than tall, exactly as a real TV shows them (a 320x256 screen
spans about 640x482 window pixels). `"square"` uses one host row per woven
scanline instead, so every low-resolution pixel is an integer 2x2 square
and a 320x256 PAL screen occupies precisely 640x512 window pixels --
slightly taller than a real CRT picture, but exact for side-by-side pixel
comparison with square-pixel emulators. The menu's *Pixel Aspect* item
flips the mode live without touching the config, and
`COPPERLINE_PIXEL_ASPECT=tv|square` overrides it for a single run.

`scaling` selects how that presentation canvas reaches the window, which is
a separate question from what the canvas is. The default `"smooth"` fits the
canvas to the window preserving its aspect ratio and interpolates, so the
picture always uses the full window height (or width) whatever fraction the
scale works out to. `"integer"` instead draws the canvas at whole-number
multiples -- the largest that fits the window, measured in physical device
pixels, and under the TV aspect a separate whole number per axis (below)
-- centred in black borders and point-sampled: every canvas pixel becomes
the same block of host pixels, with no row or column sampled twice, which
is the look WinUAE and Amiberry call integer scaling.
The fit is taken in whole canvas pixels against the physical surface --
the canvas is re-rendered at whatever factor fits, rather than drawn at
whole multiples of a fixed high-DPI texture -- so every step exists on
every display: a 2x-DPI laptop whose screen holds three physical pixels
per canvas pixel but not four gets the 3x picture, fractional desktop
scales such as 150% take their whole physical multiples the same way,
and a 5K or 6K display in fullscreen fills as much of its height as the
next whole multiple allows (the internal render factor is capped at 4x,
but the displayed multiple is not -- the display's pixels stay exact
whole blocks past the cap; only the status bar and menus, drawn at the
capped factor, are resampled there). Only when the window is too small
for even a 1:1 copy -- smaller than the canvas itself in physical pixels
-- does the picture fall back to the smooth fit rather than cropping to
what fits. RTG board modes follow the setting too: their frame is scaled
from its own native resolution, so a 640x480 board screen is drawn at 1x,
2x, 3x of *those* pixels inside the display area.

Integer scaling draws from the unresampled canvas (one host row per woven
scanline, matching `pixel_aspect = "square"`). Under the default TV aspect,
horizontal and vertical axes scale using independent integer multiples to
approximate the 4:3 CRT pixel aspect ratio (e.g. PAL pixels ~1.08x wider than
tall; NTSC ~0.85x). The scaler selects the tallest integer fit whose aspect
ratio is within 10% of the display shape. When paired with `autocrop` (which
frees vertical margin from unused borders), NTSC 200-line games on 1080p
displays achieve a 4:5 pixel aspect (1280x1000 active area), 6:7 at 1440p, and 4:5 at 4K.
PAL displays use square integer multiples until the display height accommodates
an 8:7 ratio. Odd scanline multipliers remain crisp on progressive displays
because woven line pairs are identical. If the window is too small for a 1:1
fit, scaling smoothly falls back to interpolated scaling. Selecting
`pixel_aspect = "square"` with `"integer"` enforces uniform square integer
multipliers for side-by-side pixel comparisons. When combined with `autocrop`,
integer multiples are recalculated against the active display area.
Switching integer scaling in TV mode resizes the window to the unresampled
canvas; captures always retain the configured aspect geometry. Monitor bezels
(`bezel`) use the resampled TV canvas under both scaling modes. Programmable
(ECS/AGA VARBEAMEN) and RTG displays scale with uniform integer multipliers.
The menu's *Video Settings > Scaling* item toggles modes at runtime.

`autocrop` (default off) crops the window display to the active raster window
programmed by hardware rather than displaying the entire TV aperture. Because
most software occupies less than the full raster (for example, a 320x200 screen
using 400 of 570 PAL woven lines), cropping unused borders allows the active
image to fill more of 16:9 or 21:9 monitors. When paired with `scaling = "integer"`,
the integer multiplier recalculates based on the cropped dimensions, often
allowing a larger integer scale factor.

The crop area is computed dynamically each frame from scanlines containing
fetched bitplane data. The viewport expands immediately when a program opens a
larger display and tightens smoothly after a smaller viewport has remained
stable for roughly half a second, preventing visual jitter during scene changes.
The status bar and overlay panels remain docked at the bottom of the window;
opening a menu or panel temporarily reveals the full display area so no controls
are obscured. Autocrop only affects window presentation (screenshots, frame
dumps, and recordings always capture the full configured aperture). CRT shader
presets render over the cropped area. Programmable multisync modes (such as
DblPAL or 31 kHz displays) are also cropped based on their active display
windows. Autocrop is automatically suspended when using monitor bezels or RTG
modes. The menu's *Video Settings > Autocrop* option toggles it at runtime.

`deinterlace` controls how interlaced (LACE) displays are presented. On
(the default), a motion-adaptive deinterlacer weaves the two fields into a
full-height picture where the content is static and interpolates where it
moves, recovering the full vertical resolution without combing. Off, every
field is simply line-doubled as it arrives, which shows interlace bob and
flicker much as a TV without persistence would. `COPPERLINE_DEINTERLACE=0`
overrides the config for a single run.

`phosphor` blends each presented frame with a fraction of the previous
one, approximating the exponential decay of CRT phosphor. Software that
relies on the tube to fuse field-rate flicker -- alternate-field dither
transparency or flicker-dithered animation -- reads as intended with values
around `0.3`-`0.5`,
at the cost of a slight motion trail. Off by default so screenshots and
frame dumps stay frame-exact. `COPPERLINE_PHOSPHOR=0.4` overrides the
config for a single run.

`shader` runs a GPU shader pass over the window's picture, for the tube
look a phosphor trail on its own cannot give. Three presets are built in:

- `"scanlines"` -- the line structure a 15 kHz set leaves between beam
  passes: a raised-cosine gap at the pitch of the emulated lines, with the
  brightness the gaps cost compensated back so the picture dims only
  slightly rather than by half.
- `"mask"` -- a shadow mask. The picture is modulated through staggered RGB
  phosphor triads keyed to physical window pixels, so the mask keeps its
  size whatever the Amiga resolution behind it, again
  brightness-compensated.
- `"crt"` -- the lot, in the spirit of the 1084 the Amiga shipped with: a
  bowed tube face, scanlines, an aperture grille, and a corner vignette,
  all faded in together. The face geometry is taken from the datasheet of
  the 1084's picture tube (the Philips M34EAQ10X): the bow reproduces its
  published screen-edge arcs -- the top and bottom edges bow about twice
  as far as the sides, as they do on the real screen -- and the corners
  are rounded at the scale of its 11.6 mm corner arcs. The bow shapes
  only the face outline, not the picture: a real monitor's deflection is
  corrected so the raster stays rectilinear on the curved glass, and
  straight content stays straight here too. The picture overscans the
  face like the real raster overscans the glass, filling it to the
  edges, with the bowed outline deepening the crop toward the rounded
  corners, and on-face black is lifted by a faint glass glow, the room
  light a real tube reflects, so the face keeps its silhouette even when
  the picture is dark.

`"none"` (the default; `"off"` is accepted for the same thing) presents the
picture untouched, and any value ending in `.wgsl` is the path of a shader
of your own -- see [Custom WGSL shaders](#custom-wgsl-shaders) below.

The scanline gaps are drawn at the pitch of the emulated field lines the
window is actually showing: 270 in the default TV-overscan presentation
(214 on an NTSC scan) and 285 in `"full"`, so the line structure follows
the picture rather than the window size. TV overscan with `pixel_aspect = "square"` is 285 as well --
that canvas is taller than the TV aperture and pads it with bezel rows, so
the same 270 lines are rescaled to keep their pitch across the whole
window. Interlaced content is deliberately drawn at field-line pitch
over the woven frame, which is what a 15 kHz set fed an interlaced signal
looks like, rather than one gap per woven row.

`shader_strength` (0.0 to 1.0, default 1.0) is how strongly the effect is
mixed in, so a preset can be dialled back without editing shaders. At `0.0`
the shader arithmetic is an exact no-op, but the pass still resamples the
picture through a plain bilinear sampler, which is a shade softer than the
texel-snapped pass-through the window otherwise uses at magnification.
`"none"` skips the pass altogether and is the only truly zero-cost setting.

The menu's *CRT Shader* item cycles the presets live for the rest of the
session without touching the config file; the launcher's *A/V & Emu* tab
(*Video* category) has *CRT shader* and *Shader strength* rows that do
write it.
`COPPERLINE_SHADER=crt|scanlines|mask|none|PATH.wgsl` and
`COPPERLINE_SHADER_STRENGTH=0.0..1.0` override the config for a single run.
There is no command-line flag.

The pass is presentation and nothing else. Screenshots
(`--screenshot-after`), frame dumps (`--dump-frames`), video recordings, the
[control protocol](../debugger/control.md)'s capture methods and the web
frontend all read the CPU presentation buffer, which the shader never
touches, so captures stay comparable whatever is selected here. Individual
frames also skip the pass in three cases: while a menu or overlay panel is
open (a phosphor mask and a curved face make overlay text unreadable), for
frames coming from an RTG board's scanout (see `[rtg]` below), and for
programmable multisync scan modes -- a 31 kHz scanout has no 15 kHz line
structure to reproduce.

`bezel` frames the window's picture with a monitor front, drawn at the
window's resolution so it stays sharp at any size, with the picture keeping
its aspect inside the opening. Three settings:

- `"off"` (the default) -- no frame; the picture fills the display.
- `"1084"` -- the monitor the Amiga shipped with: a pale cabinet with a
  darker moulding sunk around the tube, the model badge, the Copperline
  name where the 1084 wore its maker's, and a red power lamp.
- `"classic"` -- the plainer rounded frame Copperline drew before the 1084
  arrived.

`true` and `false` are still read, from when there was only the one frame
to turn on; `true` means `"1084"`.

A drawn bezel also changes what its tube shows: the glass presents the
whole captured raster -- every rendered line, with all the overscan border
the framebuffer captures -- rather than the tighter TV aperture the plain
window crops to. The raster fills the glass edge to edge the way a real
set's overscanned picture does, border colour and all, and the opening's
rounded corners crop into that border instead of into the picture, which
the extra border keeps clear of the arcs.

The bezel is independent of `shader` and composes with any preset: with
`"crt"` the bowed tube face sits inside the opening for the full monitor
look. Cmd+M (macOS) / Alt+M turns it off and back on to whichever front is
chosen, for the rest of the session and without touching the config;
*Video Settings > Monitor Bezel* picks the front, the launcher's *Monitor
bezel* row (*A/V & Emu*, *Video*) writes it, and `COPPERLINE_BEZEL` (a
style name, or the old `1`/`0`) overrides the config for a single run.

Like the shader pass, a bezel is presentation and nothing else: captures
never include it, and it is skipped while a menu or overlay panel is open
and for RTG scanout frames. Unlike the shader it does stay on for
programmable multisync scans -- a frame has no line structure to get wrong.

`bezel_stickers` names a folder of PNG images to draw onto the bezel as
die-cut stickers, the way owners dress a real monitor with community and
maker logos. Unset (the default) draws none. Every `*.png` in the folder
becomes one decal (up to 16, alpha respected, large sources scaled down),
laid along the cabinet's top band in file-name order with a slight
alternating tilt; each picks up a soft drop shadow and the plastic's
lighting so it reads as stuck on rather than pasted over. The folder is
re-read when a machine starts, so editing it and restarting (or switching
machine in the launcher) picks up changes; a folder that fails to load
reports on the on-screen display and falls back to bare plastic.

An optional `stickers.toml` in the folder chooses and places the images
instead, one `[[sticker]]` table per decal, drawn in written order:

```toml
[[sticker]]
image = "retro32.png"   # file name in the folder
x = 0.32                # sticker centre, fraction of the front's width
y = 0.935               # and of its height (down from the top)
width = 0.11            # width as a fraction of the front's width
rotate = -2.5           # degrees clockwise
opacity = 1.0

[[sticker]]
image = "badge.png"     # no x/y: an auto slot on the top band
```

`x` and `y` come as a pair; a table without them takes the next automatic
top-band slot (where `width` and `rotate` still override that slot's own).
Height always follows the image's aspect. The same keys, as JSON, drive
the web player's `#bezel-stickers` page hook
([the browser chapter](browser.md)), so one sheet lays out identically in
the app and on a hosting page.

Stickers ride the bezel: they draw only while a front does, follow it
through Cmd+M / Alt+M, and are presentation only -- captures never include
them. `COPPERLINE_BEZEL_STICKERS` (a folder path, or empty for none)
overrides the config for a single run.

`perf_overlay` (default `false`) shows the performance overlay at start: a
live readout of emulated fps, speed factor, per-frame emulation cost, host
utilisation, audio health, and pacer slips in the top-right corner of the
display, one line per data point (see
[the window chapter](ui.md#performance-overlay) for what each line means).
Cmd+P (macOS) / Alt+P toggles it live for the rest of the session without
touching the config, `--perf-overlay` shows it for one run, and
`COPPERLINE_PERF_OVERLAY=1|0` overrides the config for a single run; the
launcher's *Perf overlay* row (*A/V & Emu*, *Display*) writes it. Like the
transient message overlay it is presentation only: screenshots, frame
dumps, and recordings never include it.

`tint` recolours the picture like the phosphor of a monochrome monitor:
`"bw"` (black and white), `"green"` and `"amber"` (the two classic
monochrome phosphors), or `"sepia"`; `"none"` (the default; `"off"` is
accepted) presents full colour. The same five looks the web frontend's
*Screen* selector offers, produced by the same colour chain, so a tint
chosen in the browser matches the desktop. It composes with `shader` --
green phosphor under the `crt` preset makes a convincing monochrome tube.
Like the shader, the tint is presentation only: screenshots, frame dumps,
recordings and headless runs stay untinted, the status bar and overlay
menus keep their colours, and RTG board scanout (the monitor on the
board's own output, not the Amiga's video output) is never tinted. The
menu's *Screen Tint* item cycles the tints live for the rest of the
session without touching the config file; the launcher's *A/V & Emu* tab
(*Video* category) has a *Screen tint* row that does write it.
`COPPERLINE_TINT=bw|green|...` overrides the config for a single run.

(custom-wgsl-shaders)=
### Custom WGSL shaders

Pointing `shader` at a `.wgsl` file loads a fragment shader of your own into
the same pass. The quickest start is to copy one of the presets --
`src/video/window/shaders/scanlines.wgsl`, `mask.wgsl` or `crt.wgsl` in the
source tree -- and edit its `fs_main`: everything above the
`--- end shared contract ---` marker in those files is the contract, and is
byte-identical in all three.

A shader must declare exactly these bindings and both entry points:

```wgsl
struct CrtUniforms {
    // Display sub-rect of src_tex in UV space: xy origin, zw size.
    src_rect: vec4<f32>,
    // xy: viewport size in physical pixels. zw: source display texels.
    size: vec4<f32>,
    // x: strength, 0 (no-op) to 1 (full). y: scanline count across the
    // display height. zw: preset-internal, do not rely on them.
    params: vec4<f32>,
    // Preset-internal and reserved; zero for a custom shader.
    params2: vec4<f32>,
};

@group(0) @binding(0) var src_tex: texture_2d<f32>;
@group(0) @binding(1) var src_samp: sampler;
@group(0) @binding(2) var<uniform> u: CrtUniforms;

struct VOut {
    @builtin(position) pos: vec4<f32>,
    @location(0) uv: vec2<f32>,
};

@vertex
fn vs_main(@builtin(vertex_index) idx: u32) -> VOut {
    // Fullscreen triangle; the viewport restricts it to the display rect.
    let tc = vec2<f32>(f32((idx << 1u) & 2u), f32(idx & 2u));
    var out: VOut;
    out.uv = tc;
    out.pos = vec4<f32>(tc * vec2<f32>(2.0, -2.0) + vec2<f32>(-1.0, 1.0), 0.0, 1.0);
    return out;
}

// Sample the display region only, clamped half a texel inside src_rect so
// a linear tap on the bottom edge never blends in the status bar's first
// row underneath it.
fn sample_display(uv: vec2<f32>) -> vec4<f32> {
    let half_texel = 0.5 * u.src_rect.zw / max(u.size.zw, vec2<f32>(1.0));
    let lo = u.src_rect.xy + half_texel;
    let hi = u.src_rect.xy + u.src_rect.zw - half_texel;
    let tc = clamp(u.src_rect.xy + uv * u.src_rect.zw, lo, hi);
    return textureSample(src_tex, src_samp, tc);
}

@fragment
fn fs_main(in: VOut) -> @location(0) vec4<f32> {
    let uv = clamp(in.uv, vec2<f32>(0.0), vec2<f32>(1.0));
    let base = sample_display(uv);
    let strength = clamp(u.params.x, 0.0, 1.0);

    // Your own look goes here. This one is a green monochrome monitor with
    // a gap between beam passes at the emulated line pitch.
    let lines = max(u.params.y, 1.0);
    let profile = 0.5 - 0.5 * cos(6.283185307 * uv.y * lines);
    let luma = dot(base.rgb, vec3<f32>(0.299, 0.587, 0.114));
    let tube = vec3<f32>(0.2, 1.0, 0.35) * luma * (0.6 + 0.4 * profile);

    // Mixing back toward the untouched sample keeps strength 0 a no-op.
    return vec4<f32>(mix(base.rgb, tube, strength), 1.0);
}
```

Points worth knowing:

- All three bindings are fragment-visibility only. `vs_main` cannot read
  them, so all the work happens in `fs_main`.
- Sampling goes through `src_rect`. The pass draws over the display
  rectangle of a texture that also carries the status bar below it, and the
  half-texel inset is what keeps the status bar's separator hairline out of
  the bottom of a magnified picture.
- Of the uniforms, a custom shader can count on `src_rect`, `size`,
  `params.x` (strength) and `params.y` (scanline count). `params.z`,
  `params.w` and `params2` carry the built-in presets' own look parameters,
  are zero for a custom shader, and are reserved for future use.
- Making strength `0.0` a visual no-op is a convention, not something the
  loader enforces, but the *Shader strength* control and
  `COPPERLINE_SHADER_STRENGTH` are only useful if you honour it.

The file is read and checked when the window is created, when the launcher
starts a machine, and every time *Video Settings > CRT Shader > Custom* is
chosen -- which re-reads it from disk. That is the live-reload story: leave
the emulator running, edit the shader, then pick **Custom** again to see the
new version.

Checking is a parse, a full validation, and a look for the two entry points,
all before any GPU pipeline is built, so a mistake is reported as WGSL with
its line and column rather than as a driver error. Files over 1 MiB are
refused unread, on the grounds that a shader that big is a mistyped path.
Whatever goes wrong -- a missing file, a syntax error, a missing `fs_main` --
the full diagnostic goes to the log, a one-line summary appears in the
window's on-screen message, and the shader falls back to off. A bad custom
shader never fails the config, and never stops the machine from running.

`menu_scale` draws the pop-up menu at `"1x"` (the default) or `"2x"` -- the
whole menu, rows and text together. It is a start-up preference:
*Video Settings > Menu Size* changes it live without altering the saved
value, `--menu-scale` sets it on the command line, and the launcher's A/V &
Emu page (Display category) has a *Menu size* picker for the same.

`full_screen` opens the window fullscreen at start (borderless), and
`status_bar` chooses whether the status bar starts visible. Both are start-up
preferences; the runtime toggles -- `Cmd+F` / `Alt+F` for fullscreen and
`Cmd+Shift+F` / `Alt+Shift+F` for the status bar, plus their menu items --
still flip either live without changing the saved value. On the command line
`--full-screen` / `--windowed` set the fullscreen state and `--show-status-bar` /
`--hide-status-bar` set the status bar; the launcher's A/V & Emu page (Display
category) has *Start fullscreen* and *Status bar* toggles for the same. Left
unset they keep the defaults: windowed, status bar shown.

Rendering completed frames uses a worker thread by default so emulation can
advance while the previous frame is painted. The worker is an implementation
detail of presentation: screenshots, frame dumps, and recordings wait for
the exact frame they save. `COPPERLINE_THREADED_RENDER=0` forces the old
synchronous render path for comparison. Presenting the composed frame --
the texture upload, the GPU passes and the wait for the display's vsync --
runs on a second worker, so the main thread's redraw ends at hand-off;
`COPPERLINE_THREADED_PRESENT=0` presents from the main thread instead.

## `[audio]`

```toml
[audio]
floppy_sounds = true        # synthesized drive sounds (not sampled)
floppy_sounds_volume = 100  # 0-100, relative to Paula's output
# output_device = "..."     # host output device (substring); omit = system default
# output_enabled = true     # false = no sound (GUI "Disabled"); --audio/--noaudio still win
channel_mode = "stereo"     # "stereo" (default) or "mono"
stereo_separation = 100     # 0-100; 100 = hardware panning, 0 = mono
audio_filter = "auto"       # Paula filter: "auto" (guest-driven), "on", or "off"
# stem_granularity = "master,source"  # default --audio-stems-mode; see below
```

The drive sounds are generated from scratch: motor hum with spin-up/down
over a rumble that repeats with each platter revolution, and head-step
clacks (an isolated step -- the empty-drive poll, or the track-to-track
advance while loading -- lands with its rebound clatter, and fast
multi-track seeks blur into the characteristic buzz). Reading adds no
noise of its own; the loading sound is the step rhythm over the spinning
motor, as on the real mechanism. The synthesis targets were measured
from recordings of real Amiga drive mechanisms, but no sample data is
used. Only step pulses that actually fire the stepper are audible: like
a real 3.5" mechanism, an outward pulse with the head at track 0 is
gated by the /TRK0 sensor, so NoClick-style patches silence the
empty-drive poll just as they do on real hardware.

`output_device` picks the host output by a case-insensitive substring of the
names `--list-audio-devices` prints (`--audio-device` overrides it); an omitted
or unmatched name uses the system default. `channel_mode = "mono"` averages the
left and right output into both channels, and `stereo_separation` narrows the
Amiga's hardware left/right panning between full (100) and mono (0) -- so it is
ignored when `channel_mode` is mono. `output_enabled = false` runs with no sound
at all (the launcher and runtime-menu "Disabled" option); the `--audio` and
`--noaudio` CLI flags still override it. These are host-output settings that do
not change the emulated audio and are not stored in save states. The equivalent
CLI flags are `--audio-device`, `--audio-channel-mode`, `--audio-stereo-separation`
and `--list-audio-devices`.

`audio_filter` controls Paula's analogue low-pass filter, the one a
post-A1000 Amiga switches with the same CIA-A line that drives the power
LED. `"auto"` (the default) lets the guest engage or bypass it as the
software asks, matching real hardware; `"on"` and `"off"` force it either
way as a listener override. Unlike the host-output settings above it is
part of the emulated audio path, so it also affects WAV capture. Also on
`--audio-filter`, *Audio Settings > Audio Filter* in the menu, and
Cmd/Alt+A.
The status-bar PWR LED is lit whenever the machine is powered and follows
the guest's /LED line itself -- full brightness while engaged, dimmed like
an A500 rev 6+ board while released -- so this override changes what you
hear, never the LED.

On Linux with PipeWire/PulseAudio, individual sinks are not ALSA devices, so
only the `default`/`pipewire` route is offered; pick the output in the desktop
sound settings (or route Copperline in `pavucontrol`) and it follows. macOS and
Windows select each device directly.

`stem_granularity` sets the default granularity list for `--audio-stems`
(headless-only; see [](headless.md)) so it doesn't need `--audio-stems-mode`
repeated on every invocation -- the CLI flag still wins when both are given.
It has no effect without `--audio-stems DIR` on the command line.

(recording-config)=
## `[recording]`

```toml
[recording]
clip_seconds = 10   # emulated seconds kept for Save Clip as GIF; 0 = off
clip_fps = 0        # GIF frame rate; 0 = 25 on PAL, 30 on NTSC
```

The window keeps a rolling ring of the last `clip_seconds` (up to 120) of
the presented picture for [Save Clip as GIF](ui.md#saving-a-gif-clip);
`0` switches the ring and the menu item off. `clip_fps` (1 to 60) is the
rate every GIF clip is written at, the interactive one and headless
`--gif-after` captures alike; the default `0` picks half the field rate,
25 fps on PAL and 30 on NTSC. Clips land in the `[paths] recordings`
folder.

## `[input]`

```toml
[input]
port1 = "mouse"           # mouse | joystick | cd32 | analogue | lightpen | none

mouse_capture = "click"   # when to grab the mouse: click | auto | manual
autofire_hz = 0           # pulse a held fire button at this rate; 0 = off
```

(port-devices)=
### Port devices

`port1` and `port2` name the controller device plugged into each game port.
Either port accepts any device, exactly as on real hardware:

- `mouse` -- a quadrature mouse. Its three buttons are the left (`/FIRx`),
  right (`POTxY`), and middle (`POTxX`) lines.
- `joystick` -- a digital switch joystick with a fire button and a second
  button on the `POTxY` line.
- `cd32` -- a CD32 joypad: a digital joystick plus the serial button
  protocol lowlevel.library reads (Red/Blue ride the fire/button-2 lines;
  Green, Yellow, Play, Rewind and Forward exist only serially).
- `analogue` -- analogue paddles or a proportional stick presenting
  resistances on the `POTxX`/`POTxY` pins, with the two paddle buttons on
  the left/right direction lines. No live host device maps to it yet:
  drive it with `--pot-after` scripting or the control protocol's
  `input.analogue` method (positions default to centre).
- `lightpen` (alias `lightgun`) -- a light pen or light gun. Its
  photodetector pulls the port's pin 6 (`/FIRx`) low as the beam sweeps
  past it, and on the board that pin is also Agnus's `LP` input: while
  `BPLCON0` `LPEN` is set, `VPOSR`/`VHPOSR` then read the latched beam
  position instead of the live counters (ECS/AGA `BEAMCON0` `LPENDIS`
  holds the latch off). Only one game port is wired to `LP`: port 1 on
  the A1000, port 2 on the A500 and every later Amiga -- a pen in the
  other port has a working switch but its pulses reach nothing, and
  Copperline logs a warning at start-up. The pen's tip switch (a gun's
  trigger) is the port's third-button line (`POTxX`, read through
  `POTGOR`), since `/FIRx` is the pulse line itself. In the window the
  pen follows the host pointer over the display and a left click presses
  the switch; headless, `--pen-after SECS X Y` holds it over a screen
  pixel (in `--mouse-to-after` coordinates) and `--joy-after SECS red MS
  PORT` or `--click-after SECS left MS PORT` works the switch. The
  control protocol has `input.pen`.
- `none` -- an empty port.

`port3` and `port4` are the two sockets of the passive parallel-port
four-player adapter (see [`[parallel]`](#parallel-port))
and take only `joystick` or `none`. Naming a joystick there fits the adapter;
an adapter named in `[parallel]` fills every socket these keys leave unset.

The defaults are today's stock wiring: a mouse in port 1 and a joystick in
port 2 -- a CD32 pad on the CD32 profile, whose bundled controller the
machine expects (an explicit key beats the profile; a real CD32 accepts any
controller too). `--port1` / `--port2` override for one run, the runtime
menu's **Port 1/2 Device** items hot-plug a device live, and the control
protocol's `input.set_port` does the same from a script.

Putting joysticks in both ports allows two gamepads, a gamepad and keyboard,
or two keyboard mappings to drive them (see [Controller ports](ui.md#controller-ports)).

### Joystick input source

`joystick` selects the initial host source for the joystick/CD32-pad port.
There are two explicit modes, so the active source is always visible rather
than depending on whether a pad happens to be connected:

- `gamepad` (the default) -- only a physical pad drives the joystick port.
  The keyboard is left to the Amiga, so it passes straight through to a
  Shell, an editor, or Workbench, and no keys are unexpectedly captured as
  joystick input. With no pad connected there is simply no joystick input.
- `keyboard` -- use the keyboard-joystick mapping (cursor keys plus the fire
  keys), so the port stays usable without a controller.

With one joystick/CD32-pad port the mode picks its source. With two, both
sources are in play -- the gamepad and the cursor-key mapping drive one
port each -- and the mode picks which source gets the lower-numbered port;
whenever no physical pad is present, a second keyboard mapping on the
numeric keypad (`8`/`2`/`4`/`6` directions, `0` fire, `.` second button)
stands in for the gamepad, so two players can share one keyboard.

The keyboard mapping drives whatever device its port carries. In
particular, with mice in *both* ports the host mouse takes the
lower-numbered one and, in `keyboard` mode, the cursor-key mapping drives
the second as an emulated mouse: cursor keys move the pointer, the fire
keys are the left button, `X` the right, `D` the middle.

This only sets the starting mode. The status-bar toggle (the gamepad /
keyboard icon next to the volume control), `Cmd+J` / `Alt+J`, the menu's
**Joystick Input** item, and the launcher's *Input* tab all flip it live
without changing the config. `--joystick MODE` overrides this for a single
run. (`auto` is still accepted here as a backward-compatibility alias for
`gamepad`; the old auto-detect mode has been removed.)

`mouse_sensitivity` scales how fast the emulated pointer tracks the host
mouse, 0-100. `50` (the default, shown as *Default* in the GUI) is 1:1 --
exactly the previous behaviour -- `0` is a quarter speed and `100` quadruple,
on an exponential scale so each step is an even ratio. It is a host-input
scale applied to live mouse motion only: it never touches the emulated machine
or scripted `--mouse-after` input, so headless and recorded runs stay
deterministic. Set it from the launcher's *Input* tab or
`--mouse-sensitivity N`, and adjust it live with `Cmd+Shift+>` / `Cmd+Shift+<`
(`Alt+Shift+>` / `Alt+Shift+<` on Linux and Windows), which ramp while held.

### Mouse capture

Capturing the mouse confines the host pointer to the window and hides the
host cursor, so the Amiga pointer is the only one on screen. `mouse_capture`
decides when that grab is taken:

- `click` (the default) -- clicking the display grabs it. That click is a
  window action and is not passed to the Amiga, so the first click the guest
  sees is the first one aimed at it.
- `auto` -- grab as soon as the window has the focus, and again whenever it
  regains it, so no host cursor is ever loose over the display. Entering
  fullscreen grabs too. This suits a mouse-driven game or a fullscreen
  session where the host desktop is not wanted.
- `manual` -- only the shortcut grabs. Clicks on the display go straight to
  the Amiga and the host cursor is left alone.

`Cmd+G` / `Alt+G` releases and re-takes the grab by hand in every mode, and
an explicit release is never undone automatically. Opening a panel or tool
window borrows the cursor and hands the capture back when the last one
closes.

Uncaptured, host cursor motion over the display still drives the emulated
mouse in every mode; this setting only decides when the grab is taken, not
whether motion reaches the machine. Set it from the launcher's *Input* tab
or `--mouse-capture MODE`.

### Autofire

`autofire_hz` turns a *held* fire button into a pulse train at that many
presses per second; `0` (the default) leaves the button alone. It applies to
live input only -- the gamepad and the keyboard mapping -- and never to
scripted input (`--joy-after`, `--script`, the control protocol's
`input.joy`), which must replay exactly the events it was given.

The phase comes from emulated time, so the rate is the same under warp and
on PAL or NTSC. Nothing about the emulated machine changes: the port sees an
ordinary button being pressed and released on `/FIRx`. Only the fire button
is pulsed; directions and the second button pass through untouched.

`--autofire HZ` sets it for one run, and the menu's **Autofire** item cycles
off / 3 / 5 / 8 / 12 / 16 Hz live. The maximum is 30 Hz -- above that the
assert window is shorter than the frame the guest samples the port on.

### Remapping the keyboard controller

The keyboard-to-controller bindings are a host preference, not part of the
emulated machine, so they live beside the gamepad calibration rather than in
a machine config: the menu's **Input Mapping...** item edits them and Save
writes `keymap.toml` next to `gamepads.toml` (see
[Gamepad calibration](ui.md#gamepad-calibration) for the per-platform
location). Any control may take several keys -- fire ships with four aliases
so compact keyboards without the right-hand modifiers still work -- and
binding a key removes it from wherever it was before, including from the
other mapping, so the two controllers can never fight over one key. Deleting
the file restores the built-in layouts, as does the panel's **Defaults**
button.

## `[serial]` -- serial port and MIDI

```toml
[serial]
mode = "stdout"          # off, stdout, midi, tcp, tcp-connect, pty, modem, or device
# midi_out = "FluidSynth"  # midi mode: host destination, "mt32", or "coppersynth"
# midi_in = "Keystation"   # midi mode: host source, or "mt32"
# listen = "127.0.0.1:1234"  # tcp mode: bind address; modem mode: incoming-call address
# connect = "bbs.example.com:1337"  # tcp-connect mode: remote to dial
# device = "/dev/tty.usbserial-1420"  # device mode: the host serial port (COM3 on Windows)
# telnet = false           # modem mode: AT*T1 telnet NVT translation, on by default
# session = "bbs-demo.session"  # modem mode: replay a scripted session instead of TCP
```

The Amiga serial port doubles as the MIDI port. `mode` selects where
Paula's serial in/out is connected:

- `stdout` (the default) -- serial output prints to the host terminal,
  matching the historical behaviour (DiagROM and similar tools log here).
- `off` -- serial output is discarded and there is no serial input.
- `midi` -- serial in/out is bridged to host MIDI endpoints. Needs a build
  with the `midi` feature (the default); `midi_out`/`midi_in` name the
  endpoints by case-insensitive substring (a USB interface or a virtual
  port). `--list-midi` prints the host endpoints. Either may instead be
  `"mt32"`, which is Copperline's own emulated MT-32 rather than anything
  on the host, and brings its own `mt32_*` keys with it; see
  [the MT-32 chapter](mt32.md). `midi_out` may also be `"coppersynth"` --
  Coppersynth, the built-in General MIDI synthesizer, which needs no
  ROMs at all and brings its own `coppersynth_*` keys with it; see
  [the Coppersynth chapter](coppersynth.md).
- `tcp` -- serial in/out is bridged to a host TCP port, like UAE's `TCP:`
  device. `listen` sets the bind address (default `127.0.0.1:1234`);
  connect with e.g. `nc`, `socat`, or a raw-mode telnet client.
- `tcp-connect` -- the outbound counterpart of `tcp`: at startup the
  serial port dials the remote named by `connect` (required, `host:port`)
  and the session talks to that service. Point a guest terminal program
  at a telnet BBS, a `tcpser` modem bridge, or any TCP byte service. The
  connection is made once; if the remote hangs up, output drops like an
  unplugged cable until the next run. Note that the wire carries raw
  bytes: for telnet servers that insist on option negotiation, put a
  telnet-aware relay in between, or pick a BBS/port that accepts raw
  connections (most do).
- `pty` -- serial in/out is bridged to a host pseudo-terminal (Unix only).
  The slave path (`/dev/pts/N`) is logged at startup; attach a terminal
  with e.g. `minicom -D`, `screen`, or `cu -l`.
- `modem` -- a Hayes/AT-command modem personality (see
  [the modem chapter](modem.md) for a BBS quick-start and the full command
  set): the guest dials out with `ATD host:port` rather than the port being
  wired to a peer at startup, so (unlike `tcp-connect`) there is no `connect`
  address in the config; carrier presence drives /CD. `listen` here means
  something different from `tcp`
  mode's bind address: it is the address the modem answers incoming calls
  on, and an incoming connection produces `RING` on the guest's serial port
  rather than being bridged straight through -- the guest (or its S0
  register, if auto-answer is configured) has to `ATA` to pick up, exactly
  as a real modem waits for the terminal program to answer. `telnet` turns
  on `AT*T1`, the WiModem-style telnet NVT translation layer, by default at
  power-on (off by default; the guest can still toggle it with `AT*T1`/
  `AT*T0` at runtime) -- turn it on when the far end is a real telnet server
  (a BBS) rather than a raw TCP byte service, so IAC option negotiation and
  CR handling are answered instead of leaking into the data stream.
  `[serial.phonebook]` maps a dialable number to a `host:port` (or a bare
  host, which dials the modem's default port), so an `ATD<number>` from a
  terminal program's dialing directory resolves to a real address without
  the guest ever typing one:
  ```toml
  [serial.phonebook]
  "5551234" = "bbs.example.com:23"
  "5555678" = "bbs2.example.com"
  ```
  The phonebook is config-file-only; there is no launcher row for it.

  The command set is the Hayes base plus the WiModem232 `AT*` extensions
  most Amiga BBS/terminal guides are written against: `AT*B<baud>` (stored
  for CONNECT text only -- pacing always follows the guest's own SERPER
  rate), `AT*T0`/`AT*T1` (this session's telnet translation), `AT*L<port>`/
  `AT*P<port>` (listen/default outgoing port), `AT*N`/`AT*NS<n>,<pass>`
  (a stubbed network scan/join, so a guide's Wi-Fi setup steps do not error
  out), and `AT*REBOOT` (resets the state machine, like `ATZ`). `S9`
  (tenths of a second) is the WiModem connect-delay register: CONNECT
  fires immediately but remote output is withheld for `S9` of *host* time
  first, the pause older terminal software expects before BBS output
  starts. `AT&W` persists the active settings to a sidecar file beside the
  machine's other batteries; `ATZ` reloads it (an explicit `[serial]
  telnet` always wins over what was stored); `AT&F` is a hardcoded factory
  reset that ignores both.

  `session = "path"` replays a scripted dial-out session from a file
  instead of dialing out over TCP -- the determinism story for a
  modem-using headless run or test case, since live network traffic (like
  MIDI, like a camera) is otherwise outside Copperline's replay
  guarantees. See [the modem chapter](modem.md#scripted-sessions) for the
  file format; `session` cannot be combined with `listen` (the scripted
  transport plays back outbound calls only, with no inbound side).
- `device` -- serial in/out is wired to a real serial port on the host,
  named by `device`: a USB serial adapter's path (`/dev/tty.usbserial-1420`
  on macOS, `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyACM0` on Linux) or a COM name
  (`COM3`) on Windows. `--list-serial-ports` prints the host's ports. With
  a null-modem cable to a real Amiga or PC this is the wiring Amiga
  Explorer, a term program's ZMODEM transfer, or a serial link between two
  machines expects, handshake included: the guest's `/DTR` and `/RTS`
  drive the host port's DTR and RTS pins, and the host port's CTS, DSR and
  DCD come back on CIA-B, so `serial.device`'s 7-wire handshake works
  against the far end's real lines (the Amiga has no input for RI; it is
  logged on the host side when it changes). The host port follows the
  guest's line settings: the rate `SERPER` works out to is mapped to the
  nearest standard rate (Paula's divisor never lands exactly on one, so
  19172 bps becomes 19200 and 114416 becomes 115200; a rate more than 3%
  from any standard rate -- 110, 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 14400,
  19200, 28800, 31250, 38400, 57600, 76800, 115200, 230400, 460800,
  921600 -- is passed through as-is for the driver to accept or refuse),
  and the stop-bit count follows the words the guest writes (one or two).
  Host UARTs carry eight data bits: a 9-bit word goes out without its
  ninth bit, and 7-bit-plus-parity framings, which `serial.device` builds
  in software, cross the wire unchanged. Host bytes still arrive at the
  emulated rate -- Paula clocks them in at `SERPER`'s bit period, not
  instantly. A port that cannot be opened (missing, in use by another
  program, permission denied -- on Linux, the `dialout` or `uucp` group)
  is a startup error that names the ports the host does have; an adapter
  pulled mid-run degrades to an unplugged cable (every handshake input
  high, output dropped) and is reopened, with the guest's settings, when
  it comes back. The wire is the host's clock, not the emulated one: like
  the network backends, this mode is outside the byte-identical replay
  guarantees, and a save state does not carry the port (it is reopened,
  and the restored machine's DTR/RTS and rate are pushed onto it, on
  load). Needs a build with the `host-serial` feature (the default).

Every mode also drives the port's RS-232 handshake inputs, which the guest
reads on CIA-B port A (`/DSR`, `/CTS`, `/CD`) and `serial.device` reports
through `SDCMD_QUERY` and honours in 7-wire mode. `off` (and `midi`, whose
interface only uses the data lines) is an unplugged cable: every input
floats high, so a guest waiting for CTS or carrier waits forever, as on a
real machine with nothing attached. `stdout` is a ready device with no
call behind it: DSR and CTS asserted, no carrier. `tcp` and `tcp-connect`
behave as a modem: DSR and CTS asserted from startup, and carrier only
while a client is connected (or the dial-out is up) -- so a guest BBS sees
the caller hang up as carrier loss, and a terminal program sees the remote
drop the same way. `pty` reports a host terminal with the port open (all
three asserted), since a null-modem cable crosses its DTR and RTS to
these inputs and the terminal's side cannot be observed from here.
`device` reports the real lines: whatever the far end of the host port's
cable is driving on CTS, DSR and DCD, sampled continuously. The
guest's own `/DTR` and `/RTS` outputs are the CIA's pins as written, and
under `device` they drive the host port's pins too.

With an `AUX:` shell on the Amiga side, `tcp`/`pty` give a remote AmigaDOS
console. `--serial MODE` overrides the mode per run,
`--serial-connect HOST:PORT` sets the dial-out target (and implies
`mode = "tcp-connect"`), `--serial-session FILE` replays a scripted modem
session (and implies `mode = "modem"`), `--serial-device PATH` names the
host port (and implies `mode = "device"`), and `--midi-out NAME`/
`--midi-in NAME` imply `mode = "midi"`. The launcher's **I/O Ports** tab
(Serial Port page) sets all
of this interactively: **Device / Mode** picks the mode, and the mode brings
its own address with it -- **Connect** under `tcp-connect` for the
remote to dial, **Listen** under `tcp` for the local bind address -- as a
pair of boxes, host and port, or, under `device` (shown as **Host
port**), a **Port** picker that steps through the serial ports the host
has right now (re-read on every step, so a just-plugged adapter appears;
a saved path the host does not list is kept and marked). A box left empty shows its greyed default
(host `127.0.0.1` on Listen, port `1234`) and an emptied box reverts to it;
an IPv6 literal is typed bare or in brackets, and the saved key spells it
bracketed (`[::1]:1337`). Emptying both boxes unsets the key. The in-window
**MIDI In / MIDI Out** menu items select the MIDI endpoints. Under `modem`,
the page shows the same **Listen** box (the incoming-call address above)
plus a **Telnet** toggle for `telnet`; the phonebook has no row and stays
config-file-only.

The browser build has its own serial transport (the page bridges the port
to a WebSocket); see [the browser chapter](browser.md).

(parallel-port)=
## `[parallel]` -- Centronics parallel port

```toml
[parallel]
device = "printer"           # none | printer | sampler | joystick-adapter
output = "printer.raw"       # printer capture path
# device = "sampler"
# sampler_input = "MacBook Air Microphone"  # host input; omit for the default
# sampler_gain = 6.0                          # preamp gain in dB (0 = unity)
# device = "joystick-adapter"                 # four-player ports 3 and 4
```

`device` chooses the peripheral on the parallel port (one at a time). Without
this section the connector is electrically disconnected: CIA-A still produces
its hardware `PC` strobe on port-B accesses (`$BFE101`), but no peripheral
acknowledges it and port-B reads see the CIA's own pins. The equivalent per-run
flags are `--parallel DEVICE`, `--sampler-audio-input NAME`, and
`--sampler-input-gain X`; `--sampler-list-audio-inputs` prints the input-device
names and exits.

`"printer"` attaches a raw Centronics sink at `output` (a bare `output` with no
`device` still selects the printer, for compatibility). The file is created at
startup, replacing any existing file; each strobed byte is written verbatim and
returns the printer `/ACK` falling edge through CIA-A `FLAG`, including the
normal CIA interrupt delay. The printer also drives the Centronics status
lines on CIA-B port A -- SEL high, BUSY and POUT low -- so the guest's
`parallel.device` sees a ready online printer and starts sending. (Without an
attached device those lines float high, and printing waits forever for a
printer to appear, as on a real machine.) It is intentionally not decoded, since the guest may
emit any printer language; pass it to a converter or spooler afterwards.

`"sampler"` attaches an 8-bit audio sampler (digitizer) on the data lines -- the
emulated equivalent of a classic parallel-port sampler cartridge, driving
software such as AudioMaster, ProTracker, OctaMED, and TurboSound. It captures
from a host input device (cpal, like live audio output, so it needs a build with
the `frontend` feature) and presents each read of the data lines as an 8-bit
offset-binary sample in emulated time, mono (host left/right are summed).
`sampler_input` names the host device (case-insensitive substring, as
`--sampler-list-audio-inputs` prints; omitted uses the system default);
`sampler_gain` is the preamp gain in decibels (0 dB = unity) applied before the
ADC, clamped to the sampler's range (roughly -24 to +24 dB). The input device
and gain can also be changed live
from the runtime menu, and the gain with `Cmd/Alt+Shift +/-`. On macOS the CLI
binary needs microphone permission to capture a real input; routing audio in
through a loopback device such as BlackHole needs none.

`"joystick-adapter"` (also accepted as `"multitap"`) is the classic passive four-player adapter (Kick Off 2,
Sensible Soccer, Dyna Blaster, Gauntlet II, Super Skidmarks and others read
it): two switch joysticks wired straight to the connector, with no active
parts. Port 3's directions short the data pins `D0`-`D3` (CIA-A port B bits
0-3, up/down/left/right) to ground and port 4's short `D4`-`D7`; port 3's
fire shorts the Centronics `SEL` line (CIA-B `PA2`) and port 4's fire shorts
`BUSY` (CIA-B `PA0`), all active low, with a second button on either stick
on the spare `POUT` line (`PA1`). The assignment matches WinUAE's parallel
joystick model. The switches only pull down pins the guest has programmed as
inputs (the games clear `DDRB`), so a port a printer driver is driving as
outputs is left alone. `[input] port3`/`port4` (or `--port3`/`--port4`) say
which sockets hold a joystick; naming a joystick there fits the adapter by
itself, and an adapter named here fills every socket left unset. Up to four host
gamepads and the two keyboard mappings reach the sockets through the usual
routing (see [Controller ports](ui.md#controller-ports)), and `--joy-after
... 3`/`... 4`, `--script` and the control protocol's `input.joy` drive them
directly.

## `[floppy]` and `[floppy.df0]` .. `[floppy.df3]`

```toml
[floppy]
drives = 2                 # DF0 and DF1 connected; 0 disconnects every drive
speed = 100                # 100/200/400/800 percent, or 0 for turbo

[floppy.df0]
path = "demo.adf"            # single image, or:
# paths = ["disk1.adf", "disk2.adf"]   # swap playlist (shortcut cycles)
write_protected = true       # default true
# enabled = true             # implied by path/paths
```

`drives` controls how many mechanisms are wired, from zero to four. DF0 is
the internal drive on models that have one; DF1-DF3 are external drives that
answer the standard Amiga external-drive ID protocol when connected. The CDTV
and CD32 profiles default to zero, matching the physical machines; every other
profile defaults to DF0 only. A configured disk image also connects that drive
automatically, so existing configs that name `[floppy.df0]` .. `[floppy.df3]`
keep working.

`speed` accelerates the emulated drives beyond the authentic data rate.
`100` (the default) is real speed. `200`, `400`, and `800` clock the whole
data path -- platter rotation, the MFM read shifter, sync detection,
DSKBYTR, and DMA pacing -- at that multiple, so everything software can
observe stays bit-identical to real speed, only compressed in time. `0`
selects turbo: a started disk DMA transfer completes almost instantly
(deferred by two scanlines, matching other emulators' turbo modes, so
loaders that clear stale interrupt flags right after starting a transfer
still see the completion). Drive mechanics are never accelerated: motor
spin-up, head stepping, and post-seek settle always run at real time.
Faster-than-real speeds are a compatibility trade-off, exactly as in other
emulators: the operating system and most loaders tolerate them, but
software that times its own loading against the beam, CIA timers, or music
playback can break. The setting can be changed live from the runtime menu
("Floppy Speed") without restarting the machine. It applies to image-backed
bays only; a physical drive has its own `replay_speed`.

Supported image formats: standard 901120-byte DD ADF, gzip-compressed
images (ADZ), single file ZIP archives, DMS archives, UAE extended ADF, and
read-only IPF and SCP images. DMS, gzip, IPF, and SCP images are decoded at
load time and always treated as write-protected; set `write_protected = false`
on a plain ADF to allow write-through updates to the image file. A DMS archive
is unpacked cylinder by cylinder into the DD image the disk was read from, so
archives that repeat a cylinder (an advertising boot block ahead of the real
one) or omit the cylinders that read back blank load normally; high-density
DMS archives are rejected, matching the DD-only floppy support.

IPF (the SPS/CAPS preservation format) is decoded by Copperline itself rather
than through the closed-source `capsimg` library, so every build reads IPF on
every platform with nothing to install. Because an IPF preserves the encoded
track -- sync marks, gaps, and sector headers, not just sector contents -- it
carries the custom trackloaders and copy protections that an ADF cannot
express. Each track is decoded to the revolution of MFM the head would pass
over and read back through the same path as a flux capture. Two limits are
worth knowing: tracks recorded with a variable cell *rate* (the Copylock,
Speedlock, and Brierley density models) are decoded with uniform 2 us cells,
which is logged at load time and leaves a protection that measures cell timing
seeing the wrong answer; and weak ("flakey") bits are replayed as the single
deterministic revolution the file stores rather than varying per revolution.
The browser frontend shares this decoder, so it reads IPF too.

A `paths` playlist lets multi-disk software that only drives DF0: run
without a second drive: the first entry is the boot disk and the disk-swap
shortcut (`Cmd+D` on macOS, `Alt+D` on Linux/Windows) or the status-bar
swap button cycles to the next image, wrapping around.

### A real drive on a bay

A bay can be given a physical 3.5" drive instead of an image, over a
Greaseweazle:

```toml
[floppy.df0]
bridge = "greaseweazle"      # or "off"
write_protected = true       # emulator-level protection, on top of the tab
# bridge_port = "/dev/ttyACM0"   # omit to auto-detect the interface
# bridge_cable = "a"             # a/b (IBM PC) or 0..3 (Shugart)
# bridge_density = "auto"        # auto/dd/hd
# bridge_mode = "normal"         # normal/compatible/stalling
# replay_speed = "fast"          # or "normal"; fast is the default
```

A bay takes either a bridge or an image, never both: the disk in the drive
is its media, and naming a `path` alongside is an error. `bridge = "off"`
returns the bay to images and keeps the other bridge settings for later.

Nothing needs installing -- the pure-Rust FluxBridge library is built into
Copperline -- but a physical drive changes how the machine runs in several
ways: writes need both the disk's tab and `write_protected = false`, the
status bar's eject and swap do nothing for that bay, and a machine with a
physical drive is paced to wall-clock time and is not reproducible.
[](fluxbridge.md) covers the whole feature: what each option does, which mode
suits which disks, and what to expect of it.

## `[ide]` -- IDE hard disks

```toml
[machine]
profile = "A600"             # IDE needs a machine with an IDE port
                             # (A600 or A1200 Gayle, or the A4000)

[ide]
master = "AmigaSYS.hdf"      # raw flat HDF, read/write
# slave = "scratch.hdz"      # gzip-compressed hardfile, writes not kept
```

Images are opened read/write. Both kinds of HDF work directly:

- a full disk image with its own Rigid Disk Block (RDSK/PART chain),
- a bare partition hardfile (boot block starts with `DOS\x..`), which is
  wrapped in a synthesized RDB on the fly: one extra cylinder of
  16-surface x 32-sector geometry holding an RDSK and a bootable `DH0`
  PART block, with the image's own dostype. The image must be a multiple
  of 256 KiB so the partition is an exact cylinder count. Writes to the
  partition go back to the image file; writes to the synthesized RDB area
  (re-partitioning) live only for the session; and
- a disk with an **MBR-embedded RDB**: a PC master boot record whose
  partition table carries a `0x76` entry pointing at a real Amiga RDB
  embedded further into the image -- the convention both Amithlon and
  PiStorm use so a PC BIOS or Linux boot loader sees one opaque
  partition while AmigaOS finds its own RDB underneath. Copperline
  confirms an `RDSK` block actually lives within that partition's first
  16 sectors before trusting it (the same window a real Amiga's own RDB
  scan looks in), then mounts starting at the partition's LBA directly --
  the MBR sector and
  anything before the RDB are hidden from the guest, and writes to the
  RDB/partitions go straight back to the image file like any other RDB
  image.

A **gzip-compressed hardfile** attaches too -- the `.hdz` convention, or a
plainly gzipped `.hdf`. Like the floppy formats it is recognised by content
and not by name, so the extension is free. Deflate cannot be read a sector
at a time, so the image is unpacked into memory when the drive opens: the
guest sees an ordinary writable disk of either kind above, but the writes
live only in that unpacked copy -- nothing goes back to the compressed
file, and changes are lost at exit. An image that unpacks to more than
1 GiB is refused rather than held in host RAM; decompress that one to a
plain hardfile and attach it instead.

A **CHD hard-disk image** attaches too: MAME's compressed CHD container as
`chdman createhd -i disk.hdf -o disk.chd` writes it (v5, LZMA/Deflate-
compressed hunks, `GDDD` geometry metadata; `chdman` ships in MAME's tools,
`brew install rom-tools` on macOS). It is recognised by content like the
gzip form, and both kinds of hardfile convert -- an RDB image stays an RDB
image, a bare partition hardfile still gets its synthesized RDB. Sectors
are decompressed on demand, so nothing is held in memory and the image can
be as large as any HDF. The CHD itself is never written: the guest's
writes go to a copy-on-write **overlay** beside the image, `disk.chd.wov`,
created the first time the disk attaches and read back every time after,
so changes persist across sessions while the CHD stays pristine (delete
the `.wov` to return to the pristine image; `chdman extracthd` gives back
the original HDF, without the overlay's writes). A converted disk can be
slightly larger than its hardfile, since chdman pads the last cylinder of
its own geometry with zero sectors. Where the overlay cannot be created
(a read-only directory, say) the disk attaches **write-protected** with a
warning, which the guest sees as a write-protected volume: a cleanly
unmounted volume still boots, but anything that writes (icon positions,
WHDLoad saves, a volume needing validation) gets the write-protect error.
A delta CHD (one made against a parent image) is refused; flatten it with
chdman first.

A path may also name a **host directory**: its tree is built into an
in-memory volume at startup (volume name = directory name, files and
subdirectories included; entries whose names cannot exist on an Amiga
volume are skipped with a warning). The guest sees an ordinary bootable
disk and may write to it, but the volume lives only in memory -- nothing
is written back to the host directory, and changes are lost at exit. Note
that the stock A1200/A600 Kickstart `scsi.device` only probes the IDE
master; a slave drive needs a guest OS or driver that supports two units
(e.g. Kickstart 3.1.4).

To override the volume name (instead of inheriting the directory name),
the boot priority, or the filesystem, give the drive as a table with
`path` plus `name`, `bootpri`, and/or `filesystem`:

```toml
[ide]
master = { path = "/host/Games", name = "Games" }
slave = { path = "wb.hdf", bootpri = 6 }
# slave = "scratch.hdf"        # the bare-string form still works
```

The name sets the volume label of a directory mount; AmigaDOS volume
names hold up to 30 characters and cannot contain `:` or `/`. It has no
effect on a raw HDF, which carries its own label inside the image.

`filesystem` (`"ffs"`, the default, or `"ofs"`) picks the filesystem a
directory mount's in-memory volume is built with; it only applies to a
directory (an HDF/gzip image already carries its own filesystem inside
it, and Copperline refuses the key on one at config-parse time). FFS is
the default because it is the more modern, more capacious choice, but
Kickstart 1.3's ROM has no FFS handler built in -- real 1.3 hardware needs
`L:FastFileSystem` loaded from disk, or an RDB `FileSystemHeader` chain,
neither of which Copperline can bundle (it is Commodore-copyrighted). OFS
(`DOS\x00`) is built into every Kickstart ROM from 1.2 onward, so a
directory mount meant to work under 1.3 with no guest-side setup should
set `filesystem = "ofs"`:

```toml
[ide]
master = { path = "/host/Games", filesystem = "ofs" }
```

`bootpri` (-128..127, default 0) is the `de_BootPri` written into the
**synthesized** RDB's partition, which is what the ROM's strap ranks boot
candidates by. Kickstart enters DF0: at priority 5, so the default 0 loses
the tie to a bootable floppy; raise it to 6 to boot the hard disk ahead of
one, or lower it to sort two hardfiles against each other. The sentinel
-128 also clears the partition's `PBFB_BOOTABLE` flag, so the volume
mounts but is never offered for boot. It has **no effect on an image that
carries its own RDB** -- those priorities live inside the image, where
HDToolBox put them -- and Copperline logs a warning if you set it on one.

The configuration screen edits `bootpri` on the *Storage* tab's **Boot
Priority** sub-page, one row per drive (see [](ui.md)): a Priority number and a
Bootable box, the cleared box being this -128 sentinel. A drive left at 0 with
no cascade default writes no `bootpri` key.

The drive responds to ATA IDENTIFY with the Gayle byte order real hardware
uses, so both Kickstart 3.1 variants boot from it. An HDD activity LED
appears in the status bar on IDE machines. On the `A4000` profile the same
`[ide]` section attaches drives to the motherboard IDE interface at
`$DD2020` (no Gayle involved; Kickstart's `scsi.device` drives it the same
way).

A path ending in `.cue`, `.iso`, `.nrg`, or a `.chd` holding a CD (chdman's
`createcd`; one holding a hard disk, `createhd`, attaches as the hard disk
described above -- the CHD's own metadata decides, not its name) attaches
an **ATAPI CD-ROM drive** at that slot instead of a hard disk, through the
PACKET (0xA0)
command -- the same read-only SCSI-2 command engine `[scsi]` CD-ROM units
use (see below), reached over the ATA task file instead of a WD33C93 SCSI
bus. It mounts and swaps discs, plays CD audio, and answers `scsi.device`
filesystems the same way a `[scsi]` CD-ROM unit does.

(pcmcia-config)=
## `[pcmcia]` -- the A600/A1200 credit-card slot

```toml
[machine]
profile = "A1200"            # only the Gayle machines have the slot

[pcmcia]
card = "cf"                  # "none" (default), "cf", or "sram"
path = "card.hdf"            # cf: the card's image; sram: optional backing file
# size = "2M"                # sram only: 64K..4M
# read_only = false          # sram only: the card's write-protect switch
```

The A600 and A1200 carry a PCMCIA slot wired through Gayle. Copperline
fits one of two card types:

- **`card = "cf"`** -- a CompactFlash card, which is a PCMCIA ATA device.
  `path` is any image the `[ide]` drive backend accepts (an RDB HDF, a bare
  partition hardfile, a `.hdz`, or a host directory). The card presents the
  CF register layout: memory-mapped at power-on, then contiguous I/O or
  PC-style primary/secondary I/O once a driver writes the card's
  Configuration Option Register -- the layouts the Aminet CF drivers
  (`compactflash.device`, `cfd.device`, and the `scsi.device` PCMCIA
  patches) use. Kickstart's `card.resource` sees the card but does not
  mount it: install one of those drivers. To put a real card from a reader
  in the slot instead, use `[[host_disk]]` with `attach = "pcmcia"` (see
  [](host-disks.md)); the slot holds one card, so the two cannot be
  combined.
- **`card = "sram"`** -- a static-RAM memory card of `size` bytes (a
  multiple of 64K up to 1M, or of 128K up to 4M, so its CIS can state the
  size). With a `path`, the file seeds the card and is written back as the
  guest changes it (about once a second, on eject, and at exit); without
  one the card starts blank and lives for the session (and inside save
  states). `read_only = true` sets the card's write-protect switch. The
  card's CIS is what Kickstart 2.05/3.x `card.resource` reads: a card
  present at boot is added to the system as credit-card RAM, and one
  inserted later can be used through `carddisk.device` (`CC0:`).

Command-line equivalents: `--pcmcia-cf PATH` and `--pcmcia-sram SIZE`.

**Interaction with Zorro II fast RAM.** The slot's common-memory window
is `$600000`-`$9FFFFF`, inside Zorro II expansion space, and `[memory]
fast` autoconfigures upward from `$200000`. With more than 4M of fast RAM
the RAM board covers the window and, as on a real A1200 with an 8M Zorro
II expansion, Gayle's PCMCIA decode gives way: the slot is disabled, reads
as empty, and Copperline warns at start-up that the configured card will
not be seen. Keep `fast = "4M"` or less to use the slot (accelerator,
motherboard, and Zorro III RAM do not overlap it). The two can never
claim the same addresses: autoconfigured RAM always answers first.

At run time the window's **PCMCIA Card** menu (offered only on a machine
with the slot) inserts a CF image or ejects the card, and the control
protocol's `pcmcia.insert` / `pcmcia.eject` do the same headlessly; both
raise Gayle's card-detect interrupt exactly as a physical insertion does.

## `[scsi]` -- SCSI controllers

```toml
[scsi]
# controller = "a2091"       # a2091 (default), a4091, or a3000
# rom = "a2091-v7.0.rom"     # optional replacement; A2091/A4091 default to bundled open ROMs
# rom_odd = "a2091-odd.rom"  # a2091 only: split even/odd EPROM dumps
unit0 = "workbench.hdf"      # SCSI IDs 0-6
unit1 = "data.hdf"
unit2 = "game.cue"           # .cue/.iso/.nrg/.chd attaches a CD-ROM drive
# unit3..unit6 = ...
```

The `[scsi]` section attaches a SCSI host adapter with up to **seven
drives**. `controller` picks which one:

- `"a2091"` (the default on machines without onboard SCSI): a Commodore
  A2091 (Commodore DMAC + WD33C93A) as a Zorro II autoconfig board. It
  works on **any machine model** (the board needs no Gayle) and has no
  dependence on the Kickstart IDE driver -- the board's own boot ROM
  carries `scsi.device` and autoboots on Kickstart 1.3 and newer. Omit
  `rom` to use Copperline's bundled clean-room open ROM, which uses PIO for
  control commands and 24-bit DMAC transfers with safe bounce buffers for
  inaccessible or unaligned memory. This
  also sidesteps the stock A600/A1200 `scsi.device` only probing the IDE
  master. `[ide]` remains available, and both can be used at once.
- `"a4091"`: a Commodore A4091 (NCR 53C710 SCSI-2) as a Zorro III
  autoconfig board, for machines with a 32-bit CPU. `rom` is a raw A4091
  EPROM image (single ROM, so `rom_odd` does not apply); omit it to use the
  bundled open-source ROM from the [A4091 software
  project](https://github.com/A4091/a4091-software). The ROM only autoboots
  under AmigaOS -- Linux and NetBSD drive the board without it.
- `"a3000"` (the default on the `A3000` profile): the A3000's motherboard
  SCSI -- the Super DMAC at `$DD0000` driving a WD33C93. It is silicon, not
  a card, so it needs no boot ROM: Kickstart's own `scsi.device` drives it
  and autoboots from an RDB drive. It is only valid on a machine with the
  Super DMAC (the A3000).

For the A2091, omit `rom` to use `assets/a2091/copperline-a2091.rom`, or
point it at another 16K/32K/64K A590/A2091 boot ROM image. Dumps split into
even/odd EPROM halves can be given as
`rom` (even, U13) plus `rom_odd` (odd, U12). The ROM is required on the
Zorro boards because the autoboot DiagArea and the scsi.device driver
itself live in it; the autoconfig identity comes from the board (the
A2091 is Commodore product 3, with its DiagArea vector at `$2000`). The
replacement ROM sources and EPROM-pair build outputs live in `a2091-rom/`.

Each `unitN` accepts everything `[ide]` paths do: RDB images, bare
partition hardfiles (a synthesized RDB advertises a bootable `DHn`
partition, named after the SCSI ID), gzip-compressed hardfiles (`.hdz`),
CHD hard-disk images (`.chd`, writes kept in the `.chd.wov` overlay),
and host directories built into in-memory FFS/OFS volumes -- including the
`{ path = "...", name = "...", bootpri = N, filesystem = "..." }` table
form that overrides a directory mount's volume name, filesystem, and the
synthesized partition's boot priority. The HDD activity LED covers SCSI
traffic too.

A `unitN` path ending in `.cue`, `.iso`, `.nrg`, or a `.chd` holding a CD
(a hard-disk CHD attaches as a hard disk; the metadata decides) attaches a
**SCSI CD-ROM drive** at that ID instead of a hard disk: a read-only removable
SCSI-2 target (INQUIRY device type 5) serving 2048-byte blocks, with the
full READ TOC / READ CD / mode-page surface CD filesystems expect.
Cue sheets, NRG, and CHD images may mix data and audio tracks (a cue sheet's
audio tracks may be `WAVE` or `MP3` files, as described under `[cd]`
below); a bare `.iso` is a single data track. The drive answers on the host adapter's `scsi.device` like any
other unit, so mount it the way you would on real hardware: a
`DOSDrivers` mount entry (or MountList) pointing `CDFileSystem` --
CacheCDFS, AsimCDFS, and AmiCDROM work the same way -- at the controller's
`scsi.device` and the drive's unit number.

CD audio plays: the PLAY AUDIO command group streams the disc's audio
tracks into the machine's audio output at 75 sectors per second of
emulated time (as if the drive's analogue output were cabled to the
machine), the sub-channel reports the live playback position, and the
debugger's Audio tab shows the stream on its CD-DA row with the play
state, track, and position. Discs swap at runtime like CDTV/CD32 media:
the status bar's CD load/eject buttons, dropping a `.cue`/`.iso`/`.nrg`/`.chd`
on the window, the scheduled `--insert-cd-after SECS PATH` flag, or the
control protocol's `media.cd.insert` all eject the current disc, run the
tray for a second of emulated time, and mount the new one with a
medium-change unit attention for the guest's filesystem to notice.

## `[copperhf]` -- Copperline's virtual hardfile controller

```toml
[copperhf]
unit0 = "workbench.hdf"     # units 0-6
unit1 = "data.hdf"
# unit2..unit6 = ...
```

Copperline's own virtual hardfile controller, `copperhf.device` -- an
emulator-only board with no real-hardware counterpart, the Copperline
equivalent of WinUAE's `uaehf.device`. It exists to move data at zero
emulated cost: rather than modelling a real chip's register timing and
DMA behaviour like `[ide]`, `[scsi]`, and `[lide]` do, it is a purpose-built
Copperline device with a purpose-built register protocol and no
host-adapter choice to make.

Up to **seven units** (0-6), each taking the same bare-path/table drive form
as `[ide]`/`[scsi]`/`[lide]`: RDB images, bare partition hardfiles
(a synthesized RDB advertises a bootable partition, named `DH0`..`DH6` after
the unit number, from the same virtual-RDB synthesis `[ide]`/`[scsi]`/`[lide]`
use), gzip-compressed hardfiles (`.hdz`), CHD hard-disk images (`.chd`,
writes kept in the `.chd.wov` overlay), and host directories built into
in-memory FFS/OFS volumes -- including the
`{ path = "...", name = "...", bootpri = N, filesystem = "..." }` table form
that overrides a directory mount's volume name, filesystem, and the
synthesized partition's boot priority, exactly as described under `[ide]`
above. A write-protected image (a CHD whose overlay could not be created)
reports as such through `TD_PROTSTATUS`, and its writes fail with
`TDERR_WriteProt`. RDB and RDB-less images are handled identically to the other three
controllers through the same shared hardfile layer, so a unit here behaves
like the equivalent `[scsi]` unit for anything that isn't specific to the
register protocol.

**Hard disks only**: unlike `[ide]`/`[scsi]`/`[lide]`, a `unitN` path ending
in `.cue`, `.iso`, `.nrg`, or a `.chd` holding a CD is rejected at
config-parse time rather than attaching a CD-ROM drive -- `copperhf.device`
has no ATAPI/SCSI-CDROM command set behind it. Attach CD images to `[scsi]`
or `[ide]`/`[lide]` instead. A `.chd` holding a hard disk is welcome.

The guest sees `copperhf.device` with unit numbers 0-6, matching the
`unitN` key numbering. The board carries a boot ROM (a DiagArea plus a
working `copperhf.device` exec-device stub and partition mounter), so a
program that already knows the device's name can
`OpenDevice("copperhf.device", unit, ...)` and drive it directly, and an
attached unit's partitions also RDB-mount and autoboot at boot time like
any other controller's -- the mounter walks each unit's RDSK/PART chain
(synthesizing one from a bare partition hardfile exactly as `[ide]`/
`[scsi]`/`[lide]` do, see above) and offers its bootable partitions the same
way. See [](../internals/copperhf) for the board, the register protocol,
and the boot ROM's current behaviour in full.

## `[lide]` -- a lide.device-compatible Zorro II IDE board

```toml
[lide]
# board = "ripple"        # ripple (default), ride, or atbus2008
# rom = "lide.rom"         # omit for the bundled default; "" for hardware-only mode
# rom_bank2 = "cdfs.rom"   # omit for the bundled default (ripple/ride only)
drives = ["workbench.hdf", "data.hdf"]
```

A built-in Zorro II IDE board compatible with LIV2's actively-maintained
open-source [lide.device](https://github.com/LIV2/lide.device), giving
autobooting IDE storage under any Kickstart including 1.3 -- unlike `[ide]`,
which needs a Gayle or A4000 IDE port, `[lide]` works on **any machine
model**, the same way `[scsi]`'s Zorro boards do. A `.cue`/`.iso`/`.nrg` (or
CD-holding `.chd`) drive entry attaches an ATAPI CD-ROM drive, exactly as
it does on `[ide]`.

`board` picks the AutoConfig identity: `"ripple"` (the default), LIV2's
open-hardware Zorro II card with two ATA channels (four drives); `"ride"`,
LIV2's expansion-port board, which shares RIPPLE's ROM image and register
layout but has one channel (two drives); or `"atbus2008"`, the AT-Bus 2008
and its clone family (Dicke Olga, the TK accelerator boards' IDE,
CDTV-RAM-IDE, Zorro-LAN-IDE), one register model covering the whole family,
one channel, no ROM banking. None of the three wire an interrupt line --
`lide.device` is a purely polling driver.

`drive0`..`drive3` take the same bare-path/table form as `[ide]`/`[scsi]`
(RDB images, bare partition hardfiles, `.hdz`, `.chd`, host directories, and the
`{ path = "...", name = "...", bootpri = N, filesystem = "..." }` table), one
key per slot in (channel, master/slave) order: `drive0` and `drive1` are
channel 0's master and slave, `drive2` and `drive3` are channel 1's
(`"ripple"` only -- `"ride"` and `"atbus2008"` have one channel). Each is
independent, so any slot can be filled or left empty on its own, the same way
`[ide]`'s `master`/`slave` and `[scsi]`'s `unit0`..`unit6` are:

```toml
[lide]
board = "ripple"
rom = "lide.rom"
drive1 = "ch0-slave.hdf"   # channel 0 slave, with no master fitted
```

An older `drives = [...]` array is still read, so configs written before the
named keys existed keep working. It is positional and cannot express a gap
(the first empty entry ends the list), which is why the named keys replaced
it; a named key wins over the same slot in the array, and saving from the
launcher rewrites a config to the named form.

A fitted board (an explicit `board`, or a drive image) with no `rom`
defaults to a Copperline-bundled ROM from
[lide.device's GitHub releases page](https://github.com/LIV2/lide.device/releases):
`"ripple"`/`"ride"` get the CIDER/RIPPLE/RIDE build (`lide.rom`),
`"atbus2008"` gets its own `lide-atbus.rom` -- the two are different linker
layouts, not interchangeable, so which board is fitted picks which bundled
file resolves. Set `rom = ""` to opt back out into **hardware-only mode**:
no DiagArea, no autoboot, but drives still work once a disk-loaded
`lide.device` finds them -- the same setup lide's own CI uses to test
in-development driver builds
without flashing anything. `rom_bank2` (a second flash bank, e.g. LIV2's
`cdfs.rom` CD filesystem) defaults the same way alongside a fitted `rom`,
except on `"atbus2008"`, which has no ROM banking and is never offered one;
`rom_bank2 = ""` opts out on its own without touching `rom`. Either can
still be pointed at a `rom`/`rom_bank2` release download of your own, which
always wins over the bundled default.

## `[sf2000sd]` -- the SF2000 accelerator's Zorro II SD card controller

```toml
[sf2000sd]
card = "workbench.hdf"
# rom = "sf2000sd.rom"   # omit for hardware-only mode (no autoboot)
```

The SF2000 accelerator's built-in Zorro II SD card controller: a 64K I/O
window over an SPI-mode SD card, autoconfigs on the chain like `[lide]`'s
boards. `card` takes the same bare-path/table drive form as `[copperhf]`'s
units (RDB images, bare partition hardfiles, `.hdz`, host directories, and
the `{ path = "...", name = "...", bootpri = N, filesystem = "..." }` table)
-- **hard disks only**: unlike `[lide]`, a CD image path is rejected, since
the controller speaks the SD card command set, not ATAPI/SCSI-CDROM.

Unlike `[lide]`'s `rom`, there is no Copperline-bundled default: the boot
ROM is the SF2000 firmware author's own, not Copperline's to ship. `rom`
absent (or `""`) is **hardware-only mode** -- registers are live from
power-on, no autoboot, but the card still works once a disk-loaded driver
finds it. Point `rom` at a dump of your own board's flash to get autoboot.

The full SD-over-SPI command set -- including multi-block transfers -- is
implemented and verified against a real Amiga driver's source
(`docs/internals/peripherals.md`). The launcher's Storage page has a card
slot and a boot-ROM picker for the board like every other controller;
`[[host_disk]]` passthrough for a real host SD reader is the one thing not
supported yet -- see [](../internals/peripherals) for the register protocol
and its current limits.

## `[[host_disk]]` -- a real disk of the host's

Give the machine a real disk of this computer's instead of an image -- a card
in a reader, a USB drive, a drive on a SATA port. The medium is used exactly
as it is, with its own RDB, partitions, and filesystem.

```toml
[[host_disk]]
device = "sdb"                 # last name shown by `--list-disks`
fingerprint = "v1-..."         # opaque identity written by the launcher
attach = "ide-master"          # ide-master (default), ide-slave, lide0-master,
                                # lide0-slave, lide1-master, lide1-slave, scsi0..scsi6,
                                # or pcmcia (a CF card in the A600/A1200 slot)
read_only = true               # the default; false explicitly allows writes
```

`device` is the host's current enumeration name -- `sdb` on Linux, `disk4` on
macOS, `PhysicalDrive1` on Windows -- and `copperline --list-disks` prints it.
Those names can change between boots. A launcher-saved `fingerprint` is
authoritative and lets Copperline follow the same hardware to a changed name
only when exactly one attached disk matches; a missing or ambiguous match is
refused. Keep this opaque value as written. Older and hand-written entries
without it retain exact `device` lookup. To record one, select and mount the
disk afresh in the launcher, then save or launch; a plain open-and-save keeps
the field absent. An unambiguous fingerprint is sufficient for read-only use.
Persisted writable use additionally requires a fixed, non-removable disk with
a credible serial/WWN: removable media is considered weak even when a USB
bridge reports its own serial, and must be freshly selected for each writable
session, as must a fixed disk without a credible serial/WWN.

Absent `read_only` means read-only, including for older configurations that
previously relied on the writable default. Set it to `false` explicitly to
allow guest writes. The command-line equivalents make the access choice for
the current run: `--host-disk DEVICE [ATTACH]` is read-write, while
`--host-disk-read-only` is protected. An unresolved disk leaves that drive
slot empty and the machine starts anyway.

The disk this computer is running from is never offered and never opened,
whatever is written here, and no RDB is synthesised over a disk that has
none. Opening a real disk asks for permission the first time, and the host's
volumes on it are unmounted while the machine has it. Attach read-only the
first time: [](host-disks.md) covers the whole of it.

(filesys-mounts)=

## `[[filesys]]` -- host directories as live volumes

```toml
[[filesys]]
path = "/data/amiga/Workbench"
volume = "Workbench"   # optional, defaults to the directory name
bootpri = 6            # optional boot priority; default -128 = never boot

[[filesys]]
path = "/data/amiga/downloads"
readonly = true        # optional, export the directory write-protected
```

Each `[[filesys]]` entry exports a host directory to the guest as an
AmigaDOS volume on its own `HOSTFS<n>:` device, served live by the
emulator: no disk image is built, and guest reads always see the current
host contents. This differs from giving `[ide]`/`[scsi]` a directory
path, which snapshots the tree into an in-memory FFS or OFS volume at
startup (see `filesystem` above). Up to 8 mounts.

The volumes are read-write by default: the guest creates, writes, renames,
and deletes the host's files directly, and changes land in the directory
as you would expect. Set `readonly = true` to export a directory
write-protected instead -- the guest sees a read-only disk and every write
fails with the same "disk is write-protected" error a physical
write-protected disk gives, which is worth setting on anything you would
rather the Amiga could not damage. The launcher's Host Folder sub-page (under
the Storage tab) exposes the same choice as its **Access** field.

Amiga file attributes a host filesystem cannot hold -- protection bits
such as script/pure/archive, file comments, and exact datestamps -- are
kept in UAE-style `.uaem` sidecar files, read when present and written
back when the guest changes them; the sidecars stay hidden from guest
listings, and the delete-protection bit is honoured. Host filenames are
mapped between UTF-8 and the guest's Latin-1 (names with no Latin-1
spelling are hidden, since the guest could neither display nor reopen
them). Host symlinks inside the mount are followed, wherever they point:
the guest has no way to create one, so a symlink is treated as the host
user deliberately grafting a directory into the mount, the same trust
model as the UAE family.

`volume` sets the AmigaDOS volume name (up to 30 characters, no `:` or
`/`). `bootpri` enters the volume in the boot-device vote (-128..127;
the default -128 means mounted but never booted from): hard-disk boot
partitions typically sit at priority 0 and DF0: at 5, so a bootable
Workbench directory with `bootpri = 6` boots ahead of both.

Kickstart 1.3 and newer get the full feature set, booting included: a
`bootpri` above the competition boots the machine from the host
directory as `SYS:` under 1.3 exactly as under 3.1 (the service speaks
both the V36 boot-node protocol and V34's own autoboot and handler
startup conventions). Kickstart 1.2 and older lack the expansion-ROM
hook entirely and never see the mounts.

(clipboard)=

## `[clipboard]` -- host clipboard sharing

```toml
[clipboard]
share = true    # default: false -- sharing is opt-in
```

Text copied in the guest -- anything an application posts to
`clipboard.device` unit 0 as an IFF `FTXT` clip -- lands on the host
clipboard, and text on the host clipboard is available to paste in the
guest, the way WinUAE shares its clipboard. The guest side is a small
resident bridge in the Copperline services board's ROM (the same board
that serves `[[filesys]]` mounts), so it needs no guest configuration and
no software installed: under Kickstart 2.0 and later it hooks
`clipboard.device` for change notifications; under Kickstart 1.3, whose
`clipboard.device` has no hooks, it re-reads the clip every two seconds and
pushes it only when its ID is new. The
device is disk-based on 1.3 and 3.1 (`DEVS:clipboard.device`), so the
bridge waits for the boot volume to provide it, backing off and giving up
quietly on a system without one -- a game booting from its own bootblock
never sees any of this. The bridge's DOS device, `HOSTCLIP:`, is not a
filesystem and refuses everything but its own startup.

Host text reaches the guest as Latin-1 with LF line ends (characters the
Amiga cannot show become `?`, CRLF folds to LF); guest text reaches the
host as UTF-8 with the platform's line ends. Only text is shared; a
picture on either clipboard is left alone. The host clipboard is read a
few times a second while the emulator window has the focus, and only
when its text changed. Up to 1 MiB of text crosses in either direction.
A host with no clipboard to read -- a Wayland compositor that offers no
data-control protocol, with no X11 display behind it -- is reported once
in the log and then left alone rather than reopened on every poll; the
guest side of the bridge still runs, so `clipboard.get`/`clipboard.set`
over the control protocol keep working.

`share` is **off by default**, windowed and headless alike, and the bridge
is fitted only where it is asked for: `share = true` or `--clipboard`.
That is because the bridge is a unit of the Copperline services board, so
sharing puts an autoconfig board on the Zorro chain that the machine you
configured does not otherwise have. Kickstart binds the board at boot and
every Exec allocation after it lands somewhere else. That is a different
machine, and some software can tell: a program that points `COP1LC` at a
buffer before it has written the list there has the Copper read whatever
the buffer holds, and where the buffer sits decides what that is. Lotus
Esprit Turbo Challenge hangs on one layout where the data decodes as a
`MOVE` to `INTENA` that clears the master interrupt enable. A host
convenience must not cost the guest its memory map without being asked,
so it does not.

Up to and including 0.20.0 `share` defaulted on for windowed sessions
(the launcher's machines too), which is what made that Lotus hang look
like an emulation bug. It is off everywhere now; turn it back on with
`share = true` or `--clipboard`.

Headless, `share = true` is still safe for determinism: the bridge is then
reachable only through the control protocol's `clipboard.get`/`clipboard.set`
(see [Control](../debugger/control.md)), never through the host clipboard
itself, since the host clipboard is live host state a replay cannot
reproduce (see [Determinism and the host boundary](../internals/architecture.md#determinism-and-the-host-boundary)).
That is also how a recording made in a windowed session with sharing on
replays headless on the same machine: pass `--clipboard`. Netplay peers
never share, on either side of the session and even with an explicit
`--clipboard`: every peer must build the same machine, and the bridge is
part of the services board's layout, so a session where one side fitted it
could not agree on a machine at all. *Input
Settings > Share Clipboard* toggles the host side at runtime; it is
greyed out when the machine was started without the bridge, which is
part of the board's boot and cannot be added later.

## `[whdload]` -- direct WHDLoad boot

```toml
[whdload]
game = "Turrican.lha"       # .lha, .zip, or a folder with a .slave
# library = "..."           # unpacked games and saves; default:
#                           # <config dir>/whdload/save
# kickstarts = "..."        # directory scanned for Kickstart images
# args = "ButtonWait"       # extra WHDLoad command-line options
# machine_type = "auto"     # or "copperline" to boot on this machine
# whd_package = "..."       # your own WHDLoad_usr.lha
# skick_package = "..."     # your own skick*.lha

# Launcher only.
# enabled = true            # false removes the WHDLoad page entirely
# games = "..."             # the folder the Library page lists
# library_db = "..."        # default: <config>/whdload/support/launcher.db
# library_cache = "..."     # default: <config>/whdload/support/cache
```

Boots straight into a WHDLoad-installed game: the package is unpacked
into the game library (once -- saves the game writes persist there), a
minimal boot volume is synthesized around the real WHDLoad program, raw
Kickstart images from `kickstarts` are identified by content and staged
into `Devs:Kickstarts/`, and the machine is derived from the slave
header (an A1200 with 8 MiB fast RAM) unless `[machine]`, `rom`, or
`[memory]` say otherwise. `--whdload GAME` is the command-line
equivalent and overrides `game`. The whole story, including what the
support archives are and how Kickstart identification works, is in
[](whdload.md).

The developer-oriented cousin is `--run PROG`: it stages the same kind
of boot volume around an ordinary Amiga executable and warp-boots into
it. It is CLI-only by design (no config section) and is covered in
[](run.md).

## `[cd]` -- CDTV and CD32

```toml
[machine]
profile = "CD32"

[cd]
image = "disc.cue"        # cue sheet (MODE1/2048, MODE1/2352,
                          # MODE2/2336, MODE2/2352, AUDIO)
insert_delay = 0.0        # emulated seconds after power-on to insert
# nvram = "cd32-nvram.bin" # CD32 save-game EEPROM backing file (default)
```

`image` takes a cue sheet, a bare `.iso` (single data track), a Nero
`.nrg`, or a `.chd` -- MAME's compressed CHD CD format (v5, as chdman's `createcd`
writes: LZMA/Deflate/FLAC-compressed hunks with data and audio tracks).
The disc mounts on the machine's CD controller: Akiko on CD32, the DMAC on
CDTV.

NRG supports both the older `NERO`/32-bit and newer `NER5`/64-bit footer
formats, with DAO (`CUES`/`DAOI`, `CUEX`/`DAOX`) or TAO (`ETNF`/`ETN2`)
track layouts. MODE1/2048, MODE1/2352, MODE2/2336, MODE2/2352, and CD-DA
tracks are supported; multi-session discs and images with stored subchannel
bytes are rejected explicitly.

CDXL video discs need no special setting: mount the image on a `CD32`
profile and launch it as on the console. For a bare ISO, Copperline promotes
each cooked 2048-byte sector to a complete raw Mode 1 frame (including EDC
and P/Q parity) when an Akiko client requests raw sectors. CD32 discs that
use a CDTV trademark boot record for backward-compatible startup are accepted
by the same path.

CD32 FMV-enhanced titles use the same Akiko media path once the module is
fitted: top-level `fmv = true` fits the bundled open module, and naming
`fmv_rom` fits another image. Under CD32 Kickstart,
raw Video CD movie discs auto-launch the open cartridge's track player; use
up/down, Red, and Blue to select, play, and stop. The AROS system-ROM path
deliberately skips the cartridge diagnostic and therefore does not install
that player.

A cue sheet's `FILE` lines may be `BINARY` (raw sector images, single- or
multi-file) or, for audio tracks, `WAVE` and `MP3` -- the packaged form a
disc's audio tracks often come in, one file per track:

```text
FILE "game.bin" BINARY
  TRACK 01 MODE1/2352
    INDEX 01 00:00:00
FILE "game (Track 02).mp3" MP3
  TRACK 02 AUDIO
    PREGAP 00:02:00
    INDEX 01 00:00:00
FILE "game (Track 03).wav" WAVE
  TRACK 03 AUDIO
    PREGAP 00:02:00
    INDEX 01 00:00:00
```

Audio files are decoded to CD-DA as the drive reads them, not up front,
so a disc with an hour of MP3 audio loads as fast as a BIN/CUE and never
holds its decoded audio in memory. Any WAV PCM layout is accepted
(8/16/24/32-bit or float, mono or stereo, any rate); MP3 covers
MPEG-1/2/2.5 Layer III at the standard bitrates, constant or variable
(free-format streams are not read), with ID3
tags skipped and a LAME tag's encoder delay trimmed so the track is
sample-exact against the WAV it was encoded from. Sources not at 44.1 kHz
are resampled. `PREGAP`/`POSTGAP` lines add the gap sectors such files
cannot hold (they read as silence, and the TOC points past them), as does
an `INDEX 00` inside a file. Data tracks must be in `BINARY` files;
`MOTOROLA` and `AIFF` files are not supported. MP3 decoding is the
default-on `cd-mp3` Cargo feature; a build without it loads WAVE tracks
and rejects MP3 ones with a message saying so. `insert_delay` inserts the disc some emulated seconds after power-on
with the proper media-change notification; some CDTV discs only boot when
inserted after the boot screen appears. CD32 NVRAM
persists to `cd32-nvram.bin` in the `[paths]` nvram folder unless
overridden with `[cd] nvram`; a `cd32-nvram.bin` already in the working
directory from an earlier Copperline keeps being used from there.

## `[[zorro]]` -- expansion boards

```toml
[[zorro]]
metadata = "boards/megaram.toml"

[[zorro]]
metadata = "boards/myboard.toml"
# config = { mode = "fast" }  # WASM plugin boards: setting overrides
```

Each entry adds a Zorro board described by a TOML metadata file, configured
in file order after the built-in `[memory]` fast/z3 boards. For a WASM
plugin board, the optional `config` table overrides individual settings
that the plugin's manifest declares (layered over the manifest's `[config]`
defaults; the launcher's Zorro tab edits the same values). See
[](../zorro) for the metadata format, the plugin ABI, and how autoconfig
assigns addresses.

## `[a2065]` -- Ethernet

```toml
[a2065]
net = "nat"   # or "bridge", "loopback"; "none" for an isolated NIC
# interface = "en0"  # required for "bridge"
```

Fits a Commodore A2065 Ethernet board (Am7990 LANCE) on the Zorro chain;
`--a2065-net BACKEND` is the matching per-run flag, and the launcher's
**I/O Ports** tab (Networking page) has the same picker. `net` selects the
host network backend:

- `"nat"` -- userspace NAT: the guest gets outbound IPv4 internet through a
  virtual gateway with no host privileges or setup, identically on Linux,
  macOS, and Windows. Configure the guest's TCP/IP stack with IP
  `10.0.2.15`, netmask `255.255.255.0`, gateway `10.0.2.2`, DNS `10.0.2.3`
  (or let it BOOTP/DHCP). Outbound only, IPv4 only.
- `"bridge"` -- attaches complete Ethernet frames directly to `interface`, so
  the Amiga is a separate station on the physical LAN and can accept inbound
  connections from LAN peers. Use `copperline --list-net-interfaces` for exact
  identifiers, or `--a2065-interface NAME` (which implies the bridge backend).
  Configure the guest by DHCP from the real LAN or with an address appropriate
  to that LAN. The guest can reach peers and the router; communication with the
  host's own IP is adapter/OS-dependent and is not guaranteed. Frames keep the
  Amiga's source MAC, so Wi-Fi is best-effort: many access points reject a
  second source MAC behind one wireless station. Copperline reports adapter,
  driver, and permission failures at startup instead of falling back to NAT.
- `"loopback"` -- echoes transmitted frames back (self-contained, useful
  for driver bring-up).
- `"none"` -- the NIC is fitted but isolated.

Omit the section entirely for no board. Note that host networking is
inherently non-deterministic: inbound frames arrive on the host's
schedule, not the emulated clock, so a NIC board breaks byte-identical
replay and save-state determinism while traffic flows. A save state stores the
bridge adapter identifier and must be restored on a host where that adapter can
be opened. See [](../zorro) for board details, platform bridge setup, and the
NAT's limitations.

## `[toccata]` -- AD1848 sound board

```toml
[toccata]
enabled = true
```

Fits a MacroSystem Toccata sound board (an AD1848 codec) on the Zorro
chain. Its stock, open-source AHI driver (`toccata.audio`) works unmodified,
so any AHI-aware guest application gets 16-bit sound with no
Copperline-specific setup. No other options exist yet. Omit the section
(or `enabled = false`) for no board. The launcher's **I/O Ports** tab
(Audio page) has the matching fit/don't-fit toggle; host-side audio
capture and backend settings (`--audio-wav`, `--audio-stems`, device
selection) stay command-line/config-file only and have no launcher row.
The board's output joins the mixer as the `toccata` source for
`--audio-stems` (see [](headless.md)); see [](../zorro) and
[](../internals/toccata) for the register model.

## `[mhi]` -- virtual MPEG audio decoder board

```toml
[mhi]
enabled = true
```

Fits a virtual MPEG-1/2/2.5 Layer III audio decoder board on the Zorro
chain, serving the Amiga MHI API through the ported
`mhi_copperline.library`, so MHI-aware guest software (e.g. AmigaAMP) gets
hardware-accelerated MP3 decoding. No other options exist yet. Omit the
section (or `enabled = false`) for no board. Needs a build with the `mhi`
feature (on by default; off only for the wasm32 build). The launcher's
**I/O Ports** tab (Audio page) has the matching fit/don't-fit toggle;
host-side audio capture and backend settings (`--audio-wav`,
`--audio-stems`, device selection) stay command-line/config-file only and
have no launcher row.

The guest library is not auto-installed: copy the committed artifact,
`guest/mhi/mhi_copperline.library`, into the guest's `LIBS:mhi/` drawer.
AmigaAMP (and other MHI clients) find MHI drivers by scanning `LIBS:mhi/`
for `mhi#?.library`, so the file must sit in that drawer under a matching
name; check the player's own `MHISupport`/`MHI-Driver` settings if it does
not pick up the library automatically. The board's decoded output joins
the mixer as the `mhi` source for `--audio-stems` (see [](headless.md)); since
the board consumes each descriptor's bitstream at the decoded audio's own
emulated-time rate, playback through it stays deterministic and
reproducible byte-for-byte the same way `--audio-wav` captures of the rest
of Copperline's audio path are. See [](../zorro) and [](../internals/mhi)
for the register model.

## `[hostsocket]` -- bsdsocket.library without a guest TCP/IP stack

```toml
[hostsocket]
net = "nat"   # or "bridge", "loopback", "host"; "none" for a dead wire
# interface = "en0"       # required for "bridge"
# dns_server = "10.0.2.3" # only used when resolver = "dns" (see below)
# hostname = "amiga"      # gethostname() return value (cosmetic)
# address = "192.168.1.50/24" # interface address; only for "bridge" (see below)
# gateway = "192.168.1.1"     # default gateway; only for "bridge" (see below)
# resolver = "dns"            # gethostbyname() via dns_server directly instead
#                             # of the host's own resolver (the default under
#                             # "nat"/"bridge"/"host"); see below
```

Fits the bundled HostSocket board: `bsdsocket.library` for the guest, backed
by a TCP/IP stack that runs on the host instead of inside the emulated CPU.
Any bsdsocket-consuming application (an Aminet tool, an MQTT client, a game
with an online mode) opens `bsdsocket.library` and calls
`socket()`/`connect()`/`send()`/`recv()` exactly as it would against AmiTCP or
Roadshow -- but there is no guest-side stack to install, configure, or boot:
the library autoboots from the board's ROM on Kickstart 1.3 through 3.x and
on the bundled AROS ROM. `--hostsocket-net BACKEND` is the matching per-run
flag, and the launcher's **I/O Ports** tab (Networking page) has the same
picker.

`net` selects the same host network backends as the A2065 (see above for
`"nat"`/`"bridge"` details and caveats), with one important difference in
what they mean here. The guest never configures an IP address -- the
host-side stack owns addressing -- so under `"nat"` sockets simply reach the
outside world, and under `"loopback"` the guest can talk to itself
(`127.0.0.1`) with fully deterministic behavior, which also makes
`"loopback"` the right backend for reproducible headless test runs of
socket-using software. `gethostbyname()` just works under
`"nat"`/`"bridge"`/`"host"` with no further configuration (see `resolver`
below for why); under `"loopback"` lookups return failure (nothing is
listening, and nothing should be -- see `resolver`'s own note on why
loopback never routes through a real resolver).

`net = "host"` is a fourth, different kind of backend, not a `crate::net`
one at all: instead of terminating TCP/UDP on this board's own embedded
TCP/IP stack and pushing frames through a NAT/bridge/loopback backend, each
socket operation (`socket`/`connect`/`send`/`recv`/`bind`/`listen`/
`accept`/`sendto`/`recvfrom`/`getsockname`/`getpeername`) delegates
directly to a real host OS socket, the same approach Amiberry/WinUAE's own
bsdsocket emulation uses. The guest ends up sharing the host's network
identity rather than getting an address of its own: outbound connections
work with zero configuration (no interface address, no gateway, no
pcap/TAP privileges, nothing to pick), and a `bind()`/`listen()`/`accept()`
server is a plain host port bind. This is not true bridging -- the Amiga
gets no LAN IP -- but it covers the common reason people reach for bridge
mode, with none of bridge's setup. `interface`/`address`/`gateway` (below)
are all rejected outright under `"host"`, since none of them mean anything
when there is no interface of the board's own to configure. Raw ICMP
(ping) is unaffected by any of this -- `"host"` only touches TCP and UDP --
and still goes through the underlying (hardcoded to `"loopback"` under
`"host"`) smoltcp interface exactly as it would under a literal
`net = "loopback"`.

`address` and `gateway` matter only under `"bridge"`. The default interface
address/gateway (`10.0.2.15/24` and `10.0.2.2`) are Copperline NAT's own
virtual addresses, hardcoded on the NAT side too -- correct and required
under `"nat"`/`"loopback"`, but meaningless on a real physical LAN, where
nothing answers ARP for a `10.0.2.2` gateway that doesn't exist there. Set
both to match the LAN `interface` is bridged to (e.g. `address =
"192.168.1.50/24"`, `gateway = "192.168.1.1"`) -- there is no DHCP client,
so the address is always static, picked the same way you would pick one for
any other statically-configured device on that network. Leave both unset
for `"nat"` and `"loopback"`; they are rejected outright (not merely
ignored) under `"host"`.

`resolver` picks how `gethostbyname()` itself works, independent of the
addressing above. Left unset, it defaults to `"host"` under `"nat"`/
`"bridge"`/`"host"`: Copperline's own process resolves the name via the
host OS's resolver on a background thread -- the same mechanism
`[a2065]`'s NAT backend already uses internally for its own DNS
forwarding, now available directly to this board -- which is why
`gethostbyname()` just works out of the box under all three backends with
no `dns_server` to hand-configure (`net = "host"`'s own underlying smoltcp
interface is hardcoded to `"loopback"`, which couldn't reach a real
`dns_server` even if one were set). Set `resolver = "dns"` explicitly to
opt back into the board's own DNS query: its own smoltcp stack sends a
real DNS request to `dns_server` over whichever backend is fitted (or
`"loopback"` under `net = "host"`, where it will simply never get an
answer -- there is nothing to opt back into there in practice), which is
the one way to target a *specific* resolver rather than whatever the host
happens to be configured to use (a corporate/internal-only DNS server on a
bridged LAN, for instance). Explicit `resolver = "host"` is rejected under
`"loopback"`/`"none"` (there is no sane default there either, so those
backends simply get no resolver at all): routing through a real host
resolver would silently defeat loopback's whole reason for existing,
byte-identical deterministic replay. Reverse lookups (`gethostbyaddr()`)
are unaffected by this setting -- they always use the `"dns"` path's PTR
query against `dns_server`.

Do not fit this board and also boot a real guest TCP/IP stack (AmiTCP,
Roadshow, ...) in the same session -- both would add a `bsdsocket.library`,
and which one an application opens is undefined. Use `[a2065]` for testing
real stacks and SANA-II drivers; use `[hostsocket]` for running or testing
the applications above them. The determinism note on `[a2065]` applies here
too: `"nat"`, `"bridge"`, and `"host"` traffic all arrive on the host's
schedule and break byte-identical replay, while `"loopback"` and `"none"`
stay deterministic. The board state (open sockets included) rides in save
states, but live TCP/UDP peers do not survive a restore on the host side --
under `"host"` in particular, every socket a save state remembers comes
back closed (real host OS socket handles are never themselves part of the
snapshot), so the guest sees each one as if the connection had simply
dropped, the same as a resumed `"nat"`/`"bridge"` session already does for
its own live traffic.

Implemented as a bundled WASM plugin board (see [](../zorro)); its
verification record against the external bsdsocktest conformance suite
lives in `crates/hostsocket-plugin/docs/bsdsocktest-status.md`.

## `[zz9k]` -- ZZ9000 SDK crypto accelerator board

```toml
[zz9k]
enabled = true
# zorro = 3        # 2 or 3; default: 3 on a 32-bit CPU, else 2
# size = "4M"      # Zorro III window, power of two 1M..256M; Z2 is fixed at 4M
# int2 = false     # completion interrupt on INT2 instead of the INT6 default
# seed = "..."     # reserved deterministic DRBG seed (hex); no current consumer
```

Fits a register-compatible subset of the MNT ZZ9000's "SDK v2" service
platform -- the CORE, MEMORY, and CRYPTO services -- with the crypto
computed host-side: SHA-1/256/384/512, BLAKE2s, HMAC, Poly1305, ChaCha20,
ChaCha20-Poly1305 and AES-GCM AEAD, X25519 and P-256 key exchange, P-256
keygen, and ECDSA/RSA signature verification, all at host speed. The
zz9000-sdk's unmodified Amiga-side software -- `zz9k.library`, the
`zz9k-info`/`zz9k-hash`/`zz9k-aead`/... tools, and its accelerated AmiSSL
build -- detects the board exactly as it detects real hardware
(manufacturer 0x6D6E, product 4 or 3), so TLS on an emulated 68k stops
being bottlenecked by guest-side crypto. See [](../internals/zz9k) for the
protocol contract and the pinned SDK revision.

The board is pure compute: fitting it keeps the machine fully
deterministic and replay-safe, and it works headless, in save states
(including mid-operation), and on any machine profile. On Zorro II the
window is pinned at 4M -- the only Zorro II size the SDK transport accepts
shared-buffer allocations for -- and the SDK's Zorro II path polls instead
of using the doorbell, which the board handles transparently. `zorro = 3`
needs a 32-bit CPU (68020+), like any Zorro III board.

The guest picks the completion-interrupt line itself via the SDK's
`ENV:ZZ9K_INT2` / `ZZ9000.CFG` convention; `int2` here sets what the
board's config-key register reports (leave it false for the INT6 default
unless guest-side software asks otherwise).

Only the SDK services above exist: the real ZZ9000's RTG, USB, and
Ethernet faces are absent (registers read zero, services report
unsupported), so do not install the P96 `zz9000.card` display driver
against this board -- it is harmless but shows nothing.

## `[rtg]` -- RTG graphics card

```toml
[rtg]
card = "picasso2"
vram = "2M"
```

`card` is `"picasso2"`, `"picasso2plus"`, `"graffityz2"`, `"graffityz3"`,
`"z3660"`, or `"none"`; a machine takes at most one. All of these boards give
the guest high-resolution, high-colour screens through Picasso96.

`"picasso2"` fits a Village Tronic Picasso II with a CL-GD5426 graphics
controller. `"picasso2plus"` fits the later CL-GD5428 revision, reports its
distinct autoconfig serial number, and wires vertical blank to INT2. Both are
Zorro II boards, so they work with 68000/68010 and 24-bit 68EC020 machines as
well as 32-bit CPUs. `vram` selects either real board's `"1M"` or `"2M"`
memory configuration and defaults to `"2M"`; it is ignored for other cards.
Install the Picasso96 `PicassoII.card` driver and its monitor file in the
guest. The board starts on native Amiga pass-through and switches the
Copperline display to RTG only while the guest enables a valid Picasso screen.

`"graffityz2"` and `"graffityz3"` fit Ateo Concepts' Graffity, which reuses
the same CL-GD5428 core as Picasso II+ under its own autoconfig identity;
`vram` selects `"1M"` or `"2M"` for either, same as the Picasso II family.
`"graffityz2"` is a Zorro II board, so it works on any CPU. `"graffityz3"` is
a Zorro III board and needs a 32-bit address bus (68020/030/040/060), same
restriction as `"z3660"`. Install the Picasso96 `Graffity.card` driver and
its monitor file in the guest -- it ships in the classic Aminet
`Picasso96Install` package, so no separate download is needed.

`"z3660"` is a Zorro III board. It comes fitted by default on machines whose
CPU has a 32-bit address bus (the A3000 and A4000) and is unavailable on the
rest; asking for it there is an error, as it is for Zorro III RAM and
`"graffityz3"`. It needs the open-source Z3660.card driver installed in the
guest (with its monitor in `DEVS:Monitors`). With that in place, Z3660 screen
modes appear in ScreenMode, and the window shows the board's output when a
screen is opened.

The Z3660 board's stock monitor ships with the `DISPLAYCHAIN=NO` tooltype, which
models the real hardware's separate RTG monitor and never hands the display
back to the native screen. On a single-window emulator you usually want
`DISPLAYCHAIN=YES`, so the one window follows whichever screen is active.

## `[cartridge]` -- freezer cartridge

```toml
[cartridge]
model = "hrtmon"                # "none" (the default) or "hrtmon"
# rom = "/roms/hrtmon.rom"      # an HRTMon cartridge image of your own
```

Enables Action Replay-style freezer cartridge support, providing a system
monitor mapped into its own memory space that can interrupt and inspect running
software at any time.

Configuration:
- `model = "hrtmon"`: Enables the cartridge using the bundled HRTMon 2.39
  monitor (`assets/hrtmon/hrtmon.rom`), built from upstream source
  (`hrtmon-rom/README.md`) under GPL-2.0-or-later.
- `rom = "path/to/image.rom"`: Optional path to override the bundled ROM with
  a custom HRTMon-compatible cartridge ROM (used alongside `model = "hrtmon"`;
  identified by `HRT!` signature at offset 0 or 4).

The cartridge can also be enabled from the command line using `--cartridge hrtmon`
or via the launcher's **System -> Freezer cartridge** setting.

When enabled, the cartridge maps a 1 MiB memory bank at `$A10000` and maintains
live register snapshots for write-only custom and CIA registers. Triggering a
freeze (via **Tools > Freeze (HRTMon)**, `Cmd+Shift+B` / `Alt+Shift+B`, headless
`--freeze-after SECS`, or the JSON-RPC `cartridge.freeze` method) asserts a level-7
NMI, transferring execution immediately to the HRTMon monitor. Entering `x` in
the monitor resumes normal execution, while `help` displays available commands.

Cartridge memory, register snapshots, and active monitor sessions are preserved
across save states and rewind history. Input scripts and recordings log the
timed button press itself via `freeze-after SECS`. See
[](../internals/peripherals) for architectural details.

## `[debug]` -- diagnostics

```toml
[debug]
log_unmapped = "DD0000-DEFFFF"
validate_chipset = true
detect_smc = true
```

`log_unmapped` logs every CPU read and write inside the given range that no
device decodes. Reads report the floating bus value they returned, writes
report the value that went nowhere. The value is a hex `START-END` range whose
end is included (a leading `0x` is allowed), or `all` for the whole address
space.

This is how you find the registers a guest expects and Copperline does not
implement yet. A missing register is usually invisible: a read floats, a write
is dropped, and the guest either sulks or hangs with no diagnostic. Pointing
this at the window a driver probes shows the access pattern directly -- an IDE
presence probe, say, appears as a write of `$A0` to the device/head register
followed by a long run of status reads that never come back ready.

A booting Kickstart probes enough empty address space that `all` produces on
the order of a million lines per boot, so prefer a range once you know roughly
where to look.

`validate_chipset` arms the custom-register access validator: a running
report of software using the chipset in ways the hardware quietly ignores.
It flags writes to registers the fitted Agnus/Denise does not have, bits a
register does not define, writes to read-only registers and reads of
write-only ones, byte or odd-address access to word registers, access
through an address mirror, and DMA pointers aimed past the chip RAM Agnus
can address. It also covers the engines behind those registers, where
misuse hangs rather than glitches: a blit started while the previous one
is still running (there is no register-file interlock, so the running
blit is drained and the replacement starts from whatever pointer state it
left) or with its DMA switched off (BBUSY is set and the blit stays
pending until BLTEN and DMAEN are enabled), disk DMA armed against a
drive that could not serve it at that moment -- no media, or the motor
still off, the class behind the classic loader dead-spins -- and a
keyboard handshake pulse too narrow to count as one while the MCU was
waiting for it, which costs a key and stalls input until the keyboard
resynchronises after 143 ms. Each finding names the PC (or Copper address) that made the
access and the beam position, is deduplicated by (kind, register, writer)
with a repeat count, and is logged the first time it is seen. It also arms
a per-register last-writer table, which answers "what set BPLCON3, and
from where?" without a bisect. Read both over the control protocol with
`chipset.report` and `custom.writer` (see
[the control protocol](../debugger/control.md)), which can also arm and
disarm the validator live. Off by default; an unarmed machine pays nothing
for it.

`detect_smc` reports writes that land on memory the CPU has already
executed. Self-modification is legitimate on a 68000 -- decrunchers,
trackers and Copper-list patchers all do it -- but it is also where a
prefetch-related bug hides, since the CPU has already fetched the word
ahead of the one it is executing, and neither a patch applied too late
nor one applied to the wrong address leaves a trace at the moment it
happens. Each report names the written address, the instruction that
wrote it, and the distance between them, calling out a patch close enough
to sit inside the prefetch. An address counts as code once an instruction
there has retired, so an instruction patching its own extension words on
its only execution is not reported; every repeating pattern is caught on
the pass after the first. Read it with `smc.report` over the control
protocol, which can also arm and disarm the detector live. Off by
default; it costs a 1 MiB execution map while armed.

## Rollback netplay

The `--netplay-bind`, `--netplay-peer`, `--netplay-player`, and
`--netplay-session` flags start a direct two-player session. Input delay and
prediction limits use `--netplay-delay` and `--netplay-rollback`.
The configuration screen also has a **Netplay** page. Connection details are
kept for the app session and are not written to machine configuration files.
See [Rollback netplay](netplay.md) for
commands, controls, and supported machine configurations.
