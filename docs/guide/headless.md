# Headless and scripted runs

The emulated core is deterministic and independent of wall-clock pacing, so
the preferred way to verify behaviour -- in CI, in regression tests, or
while developing -- is a headless run: nothing is presented to the screen,
the core runs unthrottled, and the result is reproducible.

Capture runs (`--screenshot-after`, `--dump-frames`) never open a window or
connect to the host's display server at all, so they work in environments
without one: SSH sessions, CI runners, and sandboxes that block
window-server access.

The one exception to both is a machine with a physical floppy drive attached
(see [](fluxbridge)): its platter turns in wall-clock time, so such a run
is paced to real time rather than unthrottled, and it is not reproducible.

## Screenshots

```sh
./target/release/copperline --config copperline.example.toml --noaudio \
  --screenshot-after 30 /tmp/out-30s.png
```

`--screenshot-after SECS PATH` emulates for SECS *emulated* seconds, saves
the framebuffer as a PNG, and exits.

The flag repeats, so one run can capture several moments; the run ends
once the latest of them has been saved. Order on the command line does not
matter, and a capture that comes due while an earlier one is still waiting
for its frame is not lost:

```sh
./target/release/copperline --config copperline.example.toml --noaudio \
  --screenshot-after 10 /tmp/menu.png \
  --screenshot-after 30 /tmp/level.png \
  --screenshot-after 60 /tmp/boss.png
```

Use `--dump-frames` instead when the moments are consecutive frames rather
than points spread across a run.

## Frame dumps

For frame-to-frame rendering glitches, dump consecutive rendered frames:

```sh
./target/release/copperline --config copperline.example.toml --noaudio \
  --dump-frames /tmp/frames --dump-start 24 --dump-count 120
```

Files are written as zero-padded PNGs into the directory and the emulator
exits after the requested count. `--dump-start` defaults to 0.

## Save states

`--save-state-after SECS PATH` writes a [save state](ui.md#save-states) of
the whole machine at SECS emulated seconds and keeps running;
`--load-state PATH` restores one before the run starts, resuming from the
state's emulated timeline. Together they collapse long debug loops: pay
the boot/loading time once, then iterate from just before the scene under
investigation.

```sh
# Once: snapshot 2 minutes in, just before the scene under investigation.
./target/release/copperline --config copperline.example.toml --noaudio \
  --save-state-after 120 /tmp/snapshot-120s.clstate \
  --screenshot-after 121 /tmp/throwaway.png

# Then iterate: each run resumes at 120s and reaches 125s in seconds.
./target/release/copperline --config copperline.example.toml --noaudio \
  --load-state /tmp/snapshot-120s.clstate \
  --screenshot-after 125 /tmp/scene.png
```

`--save-state-after` repeats too, so one pass can leave snapshots at
several points to iterate from later.

The core is deterministic, so a resumed run is byte-identical to an
uninterrupted one -- screenshots from either path can be compared
directly. Scripted-input timestamps (below) are absolute emulated time:
after `--load-state` of a 120s state, a `--press-after 60 ...` has
already passed and fires immediately, and a `--press-after 130 ...`
fires 10 seconds in. Save states do not embed hard-drive or CD image
file contents; they are reopened from their original paths.

## Scripted input

Input can be scheduled at emulated timestamps, which composes with
screenshots and frame dumps to drive menus, trainers, and loaders
deterministically:

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--press-after SECS KEY` | Press and release an Amiga key (default ~100 ms hold) |
| `--key-after SECS KEY MS` | Hold a key for exactly MS milliseconds (for modifier chords) |
| `--click-after SECS BUTTON MS [PORT]` | Press a mouse button (`left`/`right`/`middle`) for MS milliseconds (default port 1) |
| `--joy-after SECS BUTTON MS [PORT]` | Press a joystick / CD32-pad control (`up`/`down`/`left`/`right`/`red` (alias `fire`)/`blue`/`green`/`yellow`/`play`/`rwd`/`ffw`) for MS milliseconds (default port 2) |
| `--mouse-after SECS DX DY [PORT]` | Apply a relative mouse motion of (DX, DY) counter steps (default port 1) |
| `--mouse-to-after SECS X Y [PORT]` | From SECS, steer the guest pointer to presented pixel (X, Y) by watching sprite 0 (default port 1) |
| `--pot-after SECS X Y [PORT]` | Set an analogue controller's stick/paddle position, 0-255 per axis (default port 2) |
| `--floppy-drives COUNT` | Connect `COUNT` floppy drives (`1` to `4`), so scheduled inserts can target empty external drives |
| `--insert-disk-after SECS DFN PATH` | Insert a disk image into `df0`..`df3` |
| `--defer-disk-insert SECS DFN` | Start with the configured drive empty, then insert its configured image |
| `--insert-cd-after SECS PATH` | Swap the CD image (`.cue`/`.iso`/`.chd`) in the machine's CD drive (CDTV, CD32, or a SCSI CD-ROM unit) |
| `--script FILE` | Run scripted-input directives from a file (below) |
| `--record-input PATH` | Record all machine-bound input for the whole run; the script is written to PATH on exit |

`KEY` is an Amiga raw key code (`0x45`, decimal also accepted) or a name:
`ctrl`, `lalt`, `lami`, `f1`, `esc`, `left`, letter and digit keys, and so
on. All the flags repeat, so several inputs can be queued:

```sh
./target/release/copperline --key-after 14.0 ctrl 500 --press-after 14.1 c
```

`--mouse-to-after` is the odd one out: it names a destination rather than
a motion. The Amiga mouse port carries a quadrature encoder with no
absolute position, and the guest turns counts into pointer pixels through
its own acceleration curve, so a relative delta cannot be aimed at a
button. Since the Amiga pointer is sprite 0, the flag instead watches
where the hardware draws that sprite and corrects the motion once per
frame until it lands, learning the pixels-per-count ratio as it goes.
`X` and `Y` are presented pixels, the same coordinates a
`--screenshot-after` PNG is measured in, so a target can be read straight
off a capture. Targets run one at a time and in timestamp order, each
holding the pointer until it arrives or gives up (about a second of
emulated time); a guest that draws its pointer into a bitplane rather
than a sprite logs a warning and is left alone. `input.mouse_to` in the
[control protocol](../debugger/control.md) is the same mechanism with a
reply.

The controller-port flags take an optional trailing `PORT` token (`1` or
`2`) naming the game port the event lands on, so any controller wiring set
with `--port1`/`--port2` (see the configuration guide) can be driven:
omitted, each flag keeps its traditional port (mouse events port 1,
joystick/pot events port 2), so existing invocations are unchanged. The
events drive the named port's electrical lines whatever device is
configured there. (One consequence of the optional token: a positional
ROM/disk path literally named `1` or `2` cannot directly follow one of
these flags -- write it as `./1`.)

```sh
# Joystick in port 1, mouse in port 2, and inputs aimed at each.
./target/release/copperline --port1 joystick --port2 mouse \
  --joy-after 43 up 3000 1 --click-after 43 left 3000 2 \
  --mouse-after 43.5 20 10 2
```

## Input recording and script files

Long input sequences live in a script file instead of the command line:
one directive per line in the flag syntax without the leading dashes,
with `#` comments, blank lines, and double-quoted paths allowed. Only the
scripted-input directives are accepted -- a typo cannot silently change
emulator configuration.

```
# drive a loader prompt, then start
joy-after 60.0 red 300
key-after 75.0 f1 200
insert-disk-after 90.0 df1 "disk 2.adf"
# port-tagged forms work here too: fire on port 1, paddles on port 2
joy-after 95.0 red 300 1
pot-after 96.0 50 200
```

Run it with `--script FILE` (combines freely with the other flags).

Rather than writing scripts by hand, record one: in the window,
`Cmd+Shift+R` on macOS or `Alt+Shift+R` on Linux/Windows starts and stops a
live-input recording, written to
`copperline-input-<YYYYMMDDHHmmSS>.clscript` in the recordings folder (see
[](ui.md#where-files-go)); the
headless equivalent `--record-input PATH` records the whole run and
writes the file on exit. Every input event that reaches the emulated
machine is captured with its emulated timestamp -- key holds, mouse
buttons and motion, joystick / CD32-pad controls, analogue pot positions,
and floppy inserts -- so a manually driven session replays
deterministically:

```sh
# Play through the section by hand once...
./target/release/copperline --config copperline.example.toml \
  --record-input /tmp/session.clscript

# ...then replay it headlessly with the same emulated inputs.
./target/release/copperline --config copperline.example.toml --noaudio \
  --script /tmp/session.clscript --screenshot-after 60 /tmp/check.png
```

Recorded times are absolute emulated seconds, which makes recordings
compose with save states: `--load-state` of a snapshot plus the script
recorded from that point is a complete, shareable reproduction. Mouse
motion is captured at frame granularity (one `mouse-after` per frame of
movement); CD inserts are not recorded -- use the `[cd]` config section
for those.

The recorder is port-aware: each port is diffed according to the device
plugged into it (mouse buttons/motion, joystick/pad controls, or analogue
`pot-after` positions), and a port token is emitted only when it differs
from the directive's default -- a session on the stock mouse+joystick
wiring records byte-identically to the pre-port-aware format. Sessions on
other wirings note it in a `# ports: port1=... port2=...` header comment;
replay the script together with the matching `--port1`/`--port2` flags.
Hot-plugging a device mid-recording closes that port's open holds; the
device change itself has no directive and is not replayed.

## A deterministic guest clock

The emulated core never depends on the host clock -- with one deliberate
exception: the battery-backed RTC mirrors host time on machines that have
one, and an RTC-less machine boots to whatever date the guest OS invents.
Both are wrong for testing time-dependent guest software. `--rtc-time`
(or `[machine] rtc_time`) fits a battery clock seeded to a fixed instant --
Unix seconds or `"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"` -- that then ticks in *emulated*
time, so every run boots to the same time and reads the same clock at the
same emulated instant, on any host. `--rtc-frozen` stops it entirely.

```sh
# Validate a TOTP generator against an RFC 6238 vector time: the guest
# boots with the clock at 2005-03-18 01:58:29 UTC (unix 1111111109),
# deterministically, on every run.
./target/release/copperline --config auth.toml --noaudio \
  --rtc-time 1111111109 \
  --screenshot-after 45 /tmp/code.png
```

Kickstart 2.0+ loads system time from the battery clock at boot on its
own; Kickstart 1.3 needs `SetClock LOAD` in the startup-sequence. A
[control-protocol](../debugger/control) session can also inspect, move,
freeze, and resume the clock mid-run with `rtc.get` / `rtc.set`.

## Audio capture

- `--noaudio` runs silent (live audio is otherwise on by default).
- `--audio-wav PATH` writes the mixed stereo output as a 32-bit float
  44.1 kHz WAV in emulated time instead of playing it -- useful for
  comparing audio behaviour across runs.
- `--audio-stems DIR --audio-stems-mode LIST` writes one or more
  granularities of stem WAV into `DIR` instead of a single mixed file
  (still 32-bit float, 44.1 kHz). `LIST` is a comma-separated subset of:
  - `master` -- `DIR/master.wav`, the same mixed-master signal
    `--audio-wav` writes, just under a different name.
  - `source` -- one file per audio source: `DIR/paula.wav`,
    `DIR/drivesounds.wav`, and (only when this run's config plausibly
    produces them) `DIR/cdda.wav`, `DIR/mt32.wav`, `DIR/coppersynth.wav`, `DIR/toccata.wav` and `DIR/mhi.wav`.
  - `channel` -- one file per named sub-channel of a source. In this
    milestone only Paula exposes sub-channels: `DIR/paula-0.wav` ..
    `DIR/paula-3.wav`, its four physical channels. `channel` is a
    deliberate opt-in -- `source` alone never writes these.

  All three are independently selectable and combinable, e.g.
  `--audio-stems-mode master,source,channel` writes every file at once.
  A `[audio] stem_granularity` config key sets the default `LIST` so it
  doesn't need repeating on every invocation; the CLI flag wins when
  both are given. `--audio-stems` is mutually exclusive with
  `--audio-wav` and with live audio, matching `--audio-wav` itself.

  A source that this run's config says it doesn't have never gets a
  stem file at all (not even a silent one) -- e.g. `cdda.wav` is only
  written when a CD32/CDTV profile or a configured CD image is present.
  This is decided once from config at startup, not from whether the
  source stays silent during the run.

  Capture is driven purely by emulated time, so it is warp-safe and
  deterministic: two runs of the same scenario produce byte-identical
  stem files, which makes them usable as golden files for regression
  tests. See [](../internals/audio) for the mixer/stem architecture.
- `--profile-live-audio SECS` runs a windowless Paula-to-cpal profiling
  workload; combine with `COPPERLINE_AUDIO_PROFILE=1` for live-audio
  counters (see [](../internals/peripherals)).

## Benchmarking

`--benchmark-until SECS` runs the deterministic core frame by frame with no
window until the absolute emulated-time target SECS is reached, then reports
host-CPU counters (emulated seconds advanced, wall-clock elapsed, frame
count, frames per second) and exits:

```sh
./target/release/copperline --config sota.example.toml --benchmark-until 30
```

It is the canonical way to measure host-CPU cost while optimising the
emulator: the core is deterministic, so the emulated workload is identical
run to run and only the wall-clock time moves. Audio defaults to the null
backend (pass `--audio` to keep live audio), and the mode is mutually
exclusive with anything that needs a window or scheduled work --
`--screenshot-after`, `--dump-frames`, `--save-state-after`,
`--profile-live-audio`, `--record-input`, scripted input, and scheduled
disk inserts are all rejected. `--bench-until` is an accepted alias.

## Live control

Scripted flags fix the whole run in advance. For a tool that needs to
inspect, decide, and steer mid-session -- set a breakpoint, resume,
rewind, inject input, capture the screen -- run the
[control protocol](../debugger/control) instead: `--control ADDR` serves
a headless machine over JSON-RPC (with `--control-token` /
`--control-info` for the auth handoff), `--control-gui ADDR` attaches
the same server to a normal windowed session, and the bundled
`copperline-ctl` drives either from the shell. `--record-input` works
with `--control` too: injected input is journaled into the same
`.clscript` format, so an interactive control session replays
deterministically.

## Investigating a run

The [headless debugger](../debugger/headless) layers on top of any of
these runs through `COPPERLINE_DBG_*` environment variables: breakpoints,
watchpoints, instruction traces, Copper-list dumps, and per-hit screenshots,
all without a window.

```sh
RUST_LOG=info \
COPPERLINE_DBG_BREAK=C033C2 COPPERLINE_DBG_DUMP=C09580:4 \
./target/release/copperline --config copperline.example.toml --noaudio \
  --screenshot-after 30 /tmp/out.png
```

For chip-bus timing questions, the [waveform export](../debugger/waveform)
records a trigger-based VCD trace of the internal chipset signals during
the same kind of run (`--waveform out.vcd --wave-trigger pc=0xC033C2
--wave-duration 20000cck`, with `--wave-signals` selecting the signal
groups) for viewing in GTKWave.

## The vAmigaTS compatibility suite

An ignored integration test runs ADFs from a local
[vAmigaTS](https://github.com/dirkwhoffmann/vAmigaTS) checkout through
Copperline with Kickstart 1.3 in DF0:, captures screenshots after the
suite's default 9-second wait, and can compare them against a baseline
directory or a vAmiga reference render. Each shipped RetroShell setup is
mirrored, including `A1200_2MB` as 68EC020/AGA/2M chip RAM and the mixed
8372A/OCS-Denise A500 ECS scheme:

```sh
COPPERLINE_VAMIGATS_DIR=/path/to/vAmigaTS \
COPPERLINE_VAMIGATS_KICK13=/path/to/kick13.rom \
COPPERLINE_VAMIGATS_FILTER=bbusy0 \
cargo test --release --test vamiga_ts -- --ignored --nocapture
```

Optional variables: `COPPERLINE_VAMIGATS_LIMIT=N` (cap test count),
`COPPERLINE_VAMIGATS_SECONDS=SECS` (screenshot delay),
`COPPERLINE_VAMIGATS_OUT=DIR` (keep generated configs and screenshots),
`COPPERLINE_VAMIGATS_BASELINE=DIR` (require PNGs to match a baseline), and
`COPPERLINE_VAMIGATS_VAMIGA=/path/to/vAmiga` plus
`COPPERLINE_VAMIGATS_VAMIGA_SETUP=NAME` (render vAmiga references via its
RetroShell regression path).

The reference renderer is vAmiga's headless build (tested against v4.4 and
the v5.0 AGA beta):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dirkwhoffmann/vAmiga
cmake -S vAmiga/Core -B vAmiga/Core/build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build vAmiga/Core/build -j8   # produces VAHeadless
```

For pixel comparison run Copperline with `COPPERLINE_SHOT_RAW=1` so the
screenshot is the native 716-wide framebuffer (the same cutout vAmiga's
regression dump uses), then rank the divergences with the offline
comparator, which normalises the two emulators' palette expansions and
capture offsets:

```sh
COPPERLINE_SHOT_RAW=1 COPPERLINE_VAMIGATS_DIR=/path/to/vAmigaTS COPPERLINE_VAMIGATS_OUT=/path/to/out COPPERLINE_VAMIGATS_VAMIGA=/path/to/VAHeadless cargo test --release --test vamiga_ts -- --ignored --nocapture

tools/vamigats-compare.py /path/to/out | less   # worst cases first
```

A full-suite sweep with references takes about an hour; screenshot
timing is frame-aligned in neither emulator, so tests with animating
output show phase noise - rank first, then eyeball pairs.
