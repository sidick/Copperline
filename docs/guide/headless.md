# Headless and scripted execution

Copperline supports non-interactive, headless execution for continuous integration,
automated regression testing, and scripted media capture. Headless runs execute
unthrottled without creating a window or connecting to a display server.

Physical floppy drives attached through [FluxBridge](fluxbridge.md) require
wall-clock pacing. For repeatable captures, use image-backed media, a fixed
RTC seed when a clock is fitted, and repeatable inputs. Live networking,
serial or audio input, and changing host files also affect replay; see the
[host boundary](../internals/architecture.md#determinism-and-the-host-boundary).

## Capturing screenshots

To emulate for a specified number of emulated seconds, write a PNG screenshot, and exit:

```sh
./target/release/copperline --config copperline.example.toml --noaudio \
  --screenshot-after 30 /tmp/out-30s.png
```

Multiple screenshots can be captured during a single execution by repeating the flag:

```sh
./target/release/copperline --config copperline.example.toml --noaudio \
  --screenshot-after 10 /tmp/menu.png \
  --screenshot-after 30 /tmp/level.png \
  --screenshot-after 60 /tmp/boss.png
```

For a screenshot-only run, the process exits after the final screenshot.
When combined with `--dump-frames`, the run exits as soon as either the frame
dump or the screenshot schedule finishes. Use separate runs if both need
to reach different end times.

(screenshot-expectations)=
## Checking screenshots against expected images

`--expect-screenshot SECS PATH [TOLERANCE]` captures the frame at SECS
exactly as `--screenshot-after` would (the same capture path, so an image
saved by `--screenshot-after` compares pixel for pixel) and compares it with
the PNG at PATH. Repeat the flag for several checks; they schedule alongside
`--screenshot-after` and the run ends after the last capture of either kind:

```sh
./target/release/copperline --config copperline.example.toml --noaudio \
  --expect-screenshot 10 expected/menu.png \
  --expect-screenshot 30 expected/level.png 0.001
```

`TOLERANCE` is optional: a number with a decimal point is the largest
fraction of pixels allowed to differ (`0.001` is 0.1 percent of the frame),
a plain integer is an absolute pixel count (`250`). Without it the images
must match exactly. Only the colour channels are compared.

A failed check prints one line naming the expected image, how many pixels
differ (or the size mismatch) and the bounding box of the differences:

```text
expect-screenshot: expected/level.png: MISMATCH 1204 of 421056 pixels differ (0.286%), bounding box (96,112)-(311,201), tolerance exact; wrote expected/level.actual.png; wrote expected/level.diff.png
```

The captured frame is written next to the expected image as
`<stem>.actual.png`, and for a same-sized mismatch a red-on-black mask of
the differing pixels as `<stem>.diff.png`. A missing expected image fails the
same way but still writes the `.actual.png`, so a new expectation is blessed
by renaming that file into place. A failed check does not cut the run
short: every other scheduled screenshot, state save and input still fires,
and the process exits with status 3 once the run finishes (see
[](#exit-statuses)).

(exit-statuses)=
## Exit statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | The run completed and every screenshot expectation held |
| 1 | Copperline itself failed: configuration, assets, host errors |
| 3 | At least one `--expect-screenshot` check failed |
| 4 | `--exit-on-return` was given but the guest program had not returned when the run ended |
| 0-255 | The guest program's AmigaDOS return code, with `--exit-on-return` (see [](run.md#exit-on-return)) |

A non-zero guest return code takes precedence over a failed expectation; a
zero one does not hide it (the run still exits 3). A guest that stops the
emulator through the [uaelib trap's](run.md#uaelib-trap) `ExitEmu` ends the
run with status 0, or 3 if an expectation had failed.

## Dumping frame sequences

To capture consecutive frames (useful for debugging animation or beam synchronization):

```sh
./target/release/copperline --config copperline.example.toml --noaudio \
  --dump-frames /tmp/frames --dump-start 24 --dump-count 120
```

Frames are saved as zero-padded PNG files (`000000.png`, `000001.png`, etc.) in the
specified output directory.

(capturing-gif-clips)=
## Capturing GIF clips

To write a stretch of the display as an animated GIF -- the same clip the
window's [Save Clip as GIF](ui.md#saving-a-gif-clip) produces, from a
scheduled emulated time instead of the last few seconds:

```sh
./target/release/copperline --config copperline.example.toml --noaudio \
  --gif-after 24 /tmp/intro.gif --gif-seconds 5
```

`--gif-after SECS PATH` starts the clip at SECS emulated seconds;
`--gif-seconds N` sets its length and defaults to `[recording]
clip_seconds` (ten seconds). Frames are thinned to `[recording] clip_fps`
(25 per second on PAL, 30 on NTSC by default), presented through the same
crop and aspect as a screenshot, and given delays from the emulated
timeline, so the file plays back at real speed however fast the run went.
The flag repeats to bracket several moments in one run; each clip is its
own file. A run ends when every scheduled capture has finished, whichever
kind comes last: a clip that completes early keeps running for a later
`--screenshot-after`, and a finished screenshot schedule waits for a clip
that is still recording. A clip has no audio track;
`--audio-wav` captures the sound of the same interval.

Timestamps are absolute like every other scheduled flag, so the capture
composes with `--load-state`, `--script` and the scheduled-input flags:
resuming a 120 s state, `--gif-after 125 clip.gif` starts five seconds
in. Because frames are taken on the emulated timeline, the same run
produces a byte-identical GIF every time. `--gif-after` cannot be combined
with `--benchmark-until`, `--gdb` or `--control`.

(save-states-headless)=
## Save states in headless runs

Save states allow fast iteration by skipping lengthy boot and loading sequences:

```sh
# Create a snapshot at 120 emulated seconds:
./target/release/copperline --config copperline.example.toml --noaudio \
  --save-state-after 120 /tmp/snapshot-120s.clstate \
  --screenshot-after 121 /tmp/marker.png

# Resume from snapshot to capture output at 125 seconds:
./target/release/copperline --config copperline.example.toml --noaudio \
  --load-state /tmp/snapshot-120s.clstate \
  --screenshot-after 125 /tmp/scene.png
```

When resuming with `--load-state`, all scheduled-input, screenshot and GIF clip
timestamps remain referenced to the original emulated timeline.

A state written by `--save-state-after` carries the same metadata card as
one saved from the window: a thumbnail of the display at the save
(rendered by the display path `capture.screenshot` uses, so it matches a
screenshot of the same frame), the emulated and wall-clock save times, a
machine summary, and the media names. Read it without a session:

```sh
copperline-ctl state-info /tmp/snapshot-120s.clstate --thumbnail /tmp/at120.png
```

prints the card as JSON and writes the thumbnail PNG (see the
[control protocol reference](../debugger/control.md#state-snapshot-files)).

## Guest code coverage

`--run PROG --coverage FILE` counts every instruction the program retires
from its first instruction to its exit and writes lcov line/function
coverage to FILE. On its own it is a capture run that ends with the program;
with `--screenshot-after` it ends with the last screenshot instead:

```sh
./target/release/copperline --factory --noaudio \
  --run build/hello --coverage build/lcov.info \
  --coverage-source-map /build/src=$PWD/src
```

The program's own debug information (`-g`, or vasm `-linedebug`; a
`PROG.elf` beside it is picked up) supplies the source lines. See
[Guest code coverage](../debugger/profiling.md#guest-coverage).

## Scripted input events

You can schedule keyboard, mouse, and joystick inputs at specific emulated timestamps:

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--press-after SECS KEY` | Press and release a key (~100 ms hold) |
| `--key-after SECS KEY MS` | Hold a key for specified duration in milliseconds |
| `--type-after SECS TEXT` | Type TEXT on the US Amiga keyboard from SECS, one key every 100 ms (below) |
| `--click-after SECS BTN MS [PORT]` | Click mouse button (`left`, `right`, `middle`) for MS (default port 1) |
| `--joy-after SECS BTN MS [PORT]` | Trigger joystick/CD32 button (`up`, `down`, `left`, `right`, `red`, `blue`, etc.) on port 1-4 (default port 2; 3 and 4 are the parallel-port adapter's sockets) |
| `--mouse-after SECS DX DY [PORT]` | Move mouse by relative delta (DX, DY) (default port 1) |
| `--mouse-to-after SECS X Y [PORT]` | Steer sprite 0 pointer to pixel coordinates (X, Y) (default port 1) |
| `--pot-after SECS X Y [PORT]` | Set analogue paddle/pot position (0-255) (default port 2) |
| `--pen-after SECS X Y [PORT]` | Hold the light pen over pixel (X, Y), the `--mouse-to-after` coordinates; a negative coordinate lifts it off (default: the port with the pen) |
| `--insert-disk-after SECS DFN PATH` | Insert a disk image into `df0`..`df3` |
| `--defer-disk-insert SECS DFN` | Delay insertion of configured disk until SECS |
| `--insert-cd-after SECS PATH` | Swap CD image (`.cue`, `.iso`, `.nrg`, `.chd`) in CD drive |
| `--freeze-after SECS` | Trigger freezer cartridge button (`--cartridge hrtmon`): HRTMon takes over at SECS |
| `--expect-screenshot SECS PATH [TOLERANCE]` | Compare the frame at SECS with a PNG ([above](#screenshot-expectations)) |
| `--script FILE` | Execute script file containing input directives |
| `--record-input PATH` | Record all inputs to script file on exit |
| `--coverage FILE` | Write lcov line/function coverage of the `--run` program to FILE when it exits or the run ends |
| `--coverage-source-map FROM=TO` | Rewrite a source path prefix in the coverage file (repeatable) |

Key identifiers can be raw key codes (`0x45`) or standard names (`ctrl`, `lalt`,
`lami`, `f1`, `esc`, alphanumeric characters).

(typing-text)=
### Typing text

`--type-after SECS TEXT` turns a host string into the key presses a person
would make on a US Amiga keyboard: letters, digits and the punctuation on
the key caps, with Shift held for upper case and shifted symbols. `\n` is
Return, `\t` Tab, `\e` Esc, `\b` Backspace, and `\\` a literal backslash;
characters the US keymap has no key for are an error. Keys are paced in
emulated time (each held 50 ms, one key every 100 ms, Shift a frame ahead of
the key it qualifies), which the keyboard MCU's ten-event type-ahead buffer
and the guest's keyboard driver take in their stride:

```sh
./target/release/copperline --config workbench.toml --noaudio \
  --type-after 40 "dir df0:\n" \
  --screenshot-after 45 /tmp/listing.png
```

The text expands into ordinary scheduled key events, so it composes with
`--press-after`, is recorded by `--record-input` as the individual keys,
keeps its absolute timestamps under `--load-state`, and is available in
[script files](#input-recording-and-script-files) as `type SECS TEXT`. The
same typing queue serves the control protocol's `input.type` and the
window's *Paste as Keystrokes* action (`Cmd+Shift+V` / `Alt+Shift+V`, see
[](ui.md)).

A light pen (`[input] port1`/`port2 = "lightpen"`) is positioned with
`--pen-after` and its tip switch / trigger is the port's `red` button in
`--joy-after` (or `left` in `--click-after`): `--pen-after 5 320 128
--joy-after 5.5 red 200 2` holds the pen over pixel (320, 128) and presses it
half a second later. The pulse only reaches Agnus from the port the board
wires to `LP` (port 2 on every Amiga after the A1000). Joysticks in the
parallel-port four-player adapter (`--parallel joystick-adapter`) are ports
`3` and `4` in `--joy-after`'s trailing PORT token.

`--freeze-after` requires an enabled cartridge (`--cartridge hrtmon` or
`[cartridge] model`, see [Configuration](configuration.md#freezer-cartridge)).
The monitor screen is captured by subsequent `--screenshot-after` commands,
and `--save-state-after` snapshots taken inside the monitor resume directly
within it. Input recordings store freeze events as `freeze-after SECS`.

(input-recording-and-script-files)=
### Input scripts and recording

Input sequences can be stored in text files (one command per line without leading dashes):

```text
# Automated test script
joy-after 60.0 red 300
key-after 75.0 f1 200
type 80.0 "dir df1:\n"
insert-disk-after 90.0 df1 "disk2.adf"
joy-after 95.0 red 300 1
expect-screenshot 100.0 "expected/level.png" 0.001
freeze-after 120.0
```

`type` (also spelled `type-after`) and `expect-screenshot` take the same
arguments as their flags.

Run with `--script`:

```sh
./target/release/copperline --config myconfig.toml --noaudio --cartridge hrtmon \
  --script test.clscript --screenshot-after 125 /tmp/out.png
```

Host clipboard sharing is off unless asked for, windowed or headless (see
`[clipboard]` in [Configuration](configuration.md#clipboard)). It fits a
services board, so it is part of the machine: replay a recording made in a
window that had it on with `--clipboard` so the headless machine matches
(headless, the bridge never reads the host clipboard, so the replay stays
deterministic).

To record an interactive session to a script file:

- Press `Cmd+Shift+R` (macOS) or `Alt+Shift+R` (Linux/Windows) in the emulator window.
- Or launch with `--record-input /tmp/session.clscript`.

## Setting a deterministic real-time clock (RTC)

To test date- and time-dependent guest software, seed the RTC with a fixed timestamp:

```sh
# Set RTC to 2005-03-18 01:58:29 UTC (Unix timestamp 1111111109):
./target/release/copperline --config test.toml --noaudio \
  --rtc-time 1111111109 \
  --screenshot-after 45 /tmp/clock.png
```

Use `--rtc-frozen` to hold the RTC at the initial seed without advancing.

## Audio capture and stem separation

- `--noaudio`: Run silently.
- `--audio-wav PATH`: Write mixed stereo output to a 32-bit float 44.1 kHz WAV file.
- `--audio-stems DIR --audio-stems-mode LIST`: Export separate WAV stems into `DIR`.
  `LIST` is a comma-separated combination of:
  - `master`: Master mix (`DIR/master.wav`).
  - `source`: Individual audio sources conditionally generated based on configured
    hardware: `DIR/paula.wav` and `DIR/drivesounds.wav` are always created, while
    `DIR/cdda.wav`, `DIR/mt32.wav`, `DIR/coppersynth.wav`, `DIR/toccata.wav`, and
    `DIR/mhi.wav` depend on the configuration and compiled features. With
    `--load-state`, additional source files are created because the restored
    machine may have different hardware; unused sources produce silent files.
  - `channel`: Individual physical hardware channels (`DIR/paula-0.wav` through `DIR/paula-3.wav`).

## Benchmarking CPU performance

Measure host emulation throughput without rendering to a window:

```sh
./target/release/copperline --config demo.toml --benchmark-until 30
```

The emulator runs unthrottled for 30 emulated seconds, prints execution metrics
(elapsed host time, emulated time, average FPS), and exits.

`--benchmark-until` cannot be combined with scheduled screenshots, frame dumps,
save-state writes, input events, floppy inserts, or input recording.

## Automated compatibility testing (vAmigaTS)

Copperline includes a test runner for the [vAmigaTS](https://github.com/dirkwhoffmann/vAmigaTS)
test suite:

```sh
COPPERLINE_VAMIGATS_DIR=/path/to/vAmigaTS \
COPPERLINE_VAMIGATS_KICK13=/path/to/kick13.rom \
COPPERLINE_VAMIGATS_FILTER=bbusy0 \
cargo test --release --test vamiga_ts -- --ignored --nocapture
```

Test options:

- `COPPERLINE_VAMIGATS_LIMIT=N`: Maximum tests to run.
- `COPPERLINE_VAMIGATS_SECONDS=SECS`: Delay before screenshot (default: 9s).
- `COPPERLINE_VAMIGATS_OUT=DIR`: Directory to save test screenshots.
- `COPPERLINE_VAMIGATS_BASELINE=DIR`: Baseline directory for automated PNG comparison.
- `COPPERLINE_VAMIGATS_VAMIGA=PATH`: Path to reference `VAHeadless` binary.


## Importing a WinUAE state

`--load-uss scene.uss` derives the CPU, chipset and memory from a WinUAE
AmigaStateFile, verifies the configured ROM, and skips one reconstructed
frame. Scheduled times start on Copperline's new timeline. See
[WinUAE state import](winuae-state.md) for commands, supported chunks and
limits on using these states for frame profiling.
