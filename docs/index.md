# Copperline

Copperline is a cycle-driven Commodore Amiga emulator (OCS, ECS, and AGA)
written in Rust. The emulator advances the CPU (68000 through 68060), Agnus,
Denise, Paula, CIAs, floppy subsystem, and chip bus on a unified colour-clock
timeline. Bus arbitration occurs per colour clock, with Copper and blitter DMA
scheduled according to hardware slot sequences.

The project home is [copperline.dev](https://copperline.dev/); the source code
is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/CopperlineHQ/Copperline).

## Core design principles

1. **Hardware-accurate modeling.** Behavior is implemented according to chip
   specifications rather than application-specific hacks or game title detection.
2. **Determinism.** Given the same configuration, media, clock seed, and timed
   inputs, the core produces the same results in headless and interactive runs.
   Live host services, such as networking and physical drives, have separate
   [replay limits](internals/architecture.md#determinism-and-the-host-boundary).
