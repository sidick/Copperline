//! Host block devices: a real disk standing in for a hard-drive image.
//!
//! An Amiga's system disk is usually a CF card, an SD card, or an IDE drive
//! that a host can read directly. Attaching one here lets the emulated machine
//! use the very disk a real Amiga boots from, rather than a copy of it.
//!
//! # Why this is the most dangerous thing the emulator does
//!
//! Everything else Copperline writes to is a file. This writes to whole
//! physical media, where a mistake is not a corrupted image but somebody's
//! only copy of their Amiga's system disk -- or, if the wrong device is
//! chosen, the host's own operating system. The whole module is arranged
//! around that:
//!
//! - The disk the host is running from is classified [`Safety::SystemDisk`]
//!   and is never offered, on any platform. Not a warning: it is not in the
//!   list. (WinUAE has no such check at all -- it infers "this is your
//!   Windows disk" from the presence of an NTFS volume -- and Amiberry's
//!   equivalent is dead code that is never called.)
//! - Every other whole device is offered. An Amiga disk usually arrives in a
//!   card reader, but a drive on a SATA port is as usable as one on USB and
//!   the emulator is in no position to say which somebody meant; internal
//!   ones are labelled, not withheld. The system disk is the case that is
//!   never right, and it is the one that is refused.
//! - Enumeration never opens anything, so listing devices cannot disturb
//!   them, cannot spin up a sleeping drive, and needs no privileges.
//!
//! # Privileges
//!
//! Reading raw media is privileged on every supported host, and each one
//! grants it differently, so the escalation lives in the platform backend
//! rather than here. The shape they share: the user is asked once, by the
//! system's own prompt, and what comes back is an already-open handle to one
//! named device -- a capability that cannot be turned on anything else.
//!
//! # Sector sizes
//!
//! The guest reads and writes 512-byte sectors ([`crate::harddrive::SECTOR_SIZE`]),
//! and modern media often does not: 4096 is common, and a host may refuse
//! any transfer that is not a whole number of its own blocks. Translating
//! between the two is the backend's job, so the emulated machine sees the
//! 512-byte device it expects whatever the media underneath is.

// A platform backend supplies three things: `list_devices`, `take_disks`
// (get the host to give the named disks up, asking for whatever privilege
// that costs, and return something that holds them), and `lend` (turn one
// held disk into a [`BlockDevice`] for a machine, leaving the hold in
// place). Everything above that -- the safety rules, which disks are held
// and on what terms, when to ask and when a held disk is simply lent again
// -- is decided here, once, so a rule added here reaches every host.
