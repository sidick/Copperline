//! Making fresh Amiga disk images: floppies (ADF) and hard drives (HDF).
//!
//! Nothing here touches the emulated machine. It is a workshop: the
//! launcher's *Create Image* page drives it, and what comes out is meant to
//! be usable anywhere -- another emulator, or a real Amiga through a CF
//! card -- so every structure is written the way AmigaDOS writes it rather
//! than the way any one emulator happens to accept.
//!
//! Two independent sources were used to pin the layouts down, and they
//! agree: `amitools` (cnvogelg), which states the block structures
//! directly, and WinUAE's `disk.cpp`, which writes the same bytes with the
//! constants folded in. Where WinUAE has a magic number the derivation is
//! noted beside it, because a magic number nobody can re-derive is how
//! these formats get quietly wrong.
//!
//! A big image is created sparse by default -- the length is set and only
//! the blocks that carry structure are written -- so a 2 GB hard drive
//! costs a few kilobytes of writes and whatever the host filesystem
//! chooses to allocate. That is `std` alone on Unix, where setting the
//! length of a file leaves a hole; NTFS allocates unless a file is marked
//! sparse first, so [`mark_sparse`] is the one platform call here.
