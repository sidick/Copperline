//! Talking to openretro.org.
//!
//! The service has no published API. What follows was recovered by reading
//! the FS-UAE launcher, which is the other program that syncs this
//! database, and then confirmed against the live service; nothing here is
//! taken from its code, and the storage and matching Copperline does with
//! the result are its own.
//!
//! Three requests, in order:
//!
//! 1. `POST /api/auth` -- form-encoded `username`, `password`, `device_id`
//!    and `device_name`, answering with a short auth token. The password is
//!    needed for this request and nothing else.
//! 2. `GET /api/sync/amiga/games?v=3&sync=<cursor>` -- authenticated with
//!    the token as HTTP Basic. Answers with a run of records rather than
//!    JSON; see [`Record`]. A page holds up to five hundred, and the next
//!    page starts from the highest sync id in this one, so a resync asks
//!    only for what has changed since.
//! 3. `GET /image/<sha1>?s=<pixels>` -- cover art, as PNG, at whatever size
//!    is asked for.
//!
//! **Over TLS, always.** The FS-UAE client defaults to `http`, which puts a
//! password on the wire in clear; this one has no such mode.
