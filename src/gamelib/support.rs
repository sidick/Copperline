//! Fetching the two archives WHDLoad staging needs.
//!
//! `tools/fetch-whdload.sh` does this at packaging time so a release
//! carries them; a build from source has neither until someone runs the
//! script. The Download button does the same work from inside the
//! launcher, from the same URLs and against the same pinned digests, so
//! nobody has to find a shell to get started.
//!
//! The digests are the point. Both archives are fetched over the network
//! from hosts nobody here controls, unpacked, and then *run on the
//! emulated machine*, so a file that is not the file expected is not
//! written at all. They are pinned in several places -- this module, the
//! script, the Flatpak manifest, the Homebrew formula -- and
//! [`tests::the_pinned_digests_match_the_fetch_script`] is what keeps this
//! copy honest with the script's.
