Copperline supports two VS Code integrations. Both launch a real emulator
window and debug the Amiga program's source. Choose the extension for the
workflow you want:

| Integration | Use it for | Launch type |
|---|---|---|
| **Copperline Amiga Debug** | Source and instruction stepping, Step Back, variables, memory, chipset registers, native debugger windows, and `.cpuprofile` captures. | `copperline` |
| **Bartman's Amiga C/C++ extension, Copperline fork** | Its bundled compiler and patched GDB, source annotations, and the visual CPU/DMA, Copper, bitmap, and blitter profiler. | `amiga` |

This chapter sets up Copperline's native extension. For the illustrated
graphics workflow and a reproducible installation of the separate Bartman
fork, follow [Bartman with Copperline](vscode-bartman.md). That installation
does not depend on the upstream pull request being merged.

You can install both extensions. Select the appropriate launch configuration
in **Run and Debug**, and stop one session before starting the other.

## Build Copperline

The debugging features in these chapters ship in Copperline 0.19.0 and
later. The setup was checked against Copperline commit
[`3d334a11`](https://github.com/CopperlineHQ/Copperline/commit/3d334a11),
which includes the Bartman debugger startup fixes. An older installed
release does not contain them: install 0.19.0 or newer, or build from
source as below.

Install the platform prerequisites in [Getting started](../guide/getting-started.md),
then build both programs from a current Copperline checkout:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/CopperlineHQ/Copperline.git
cd Copperline
cargo build --release --locked --bin copperline --bin copperline-ctl
```

Keep the checkout in place and point VS Code at the executables in
`target/release`. On Windows they have an `.exe` suffix. Use a release build;
debug builds are too slow for this workflow.

A release package works instead of a source build once it carries the
features you need: every package ships `copperline-ctl` next to the
emulator (Homebrew on PATH, the macOS bundle's `Contents/MacOS`, the Windows
zip folder, the AppImage's companion tools tarball, or the Flatpak's
`/app/bin`); [Command-line tools](../guide/getting-started.md#command-line-tools)
lists the paths to put in the settings below.

The examples boot the bundled open-source AROS ROM, so no Kickstart download
is needed. If you move the executables out of the checkout, copy
`assets/aros/` alongside them, preserving the directory name `aros` and its
licence files. The resulting layout includes:

```text
copperline
copperline-ctl
aros/
  aros-amiga-m68k-rom.bin
  aros-amiga-m68k-ext.bin
```

If using your own ROM, normal direct executable launching supports Kickstart
1.3 and newer, including the A500 KS1.3 preset. Keep `detach` disabled on
1.3; detached launches require Kickstart 2.0+ or AROS. See
[Direct executable launching](../guide/run.md).

## Install Copperline Amiga Debug

With Node.js and npm installed, package the extension from the same checkout:

```sh
cd tools/vscode-copperline
npx --yes @vscode/vsce package --no-dependencies --out copperline-debug.vsix
code --install-extension ./copperline-debug.vsix --force
```

There is no separate JavaScript compilation step. If `code` is not on PATH,
run **Extensions: Install from VSIX...** in VS Code's command palette and
select the generated file. Reload the VS Code window after replacing an
already loaded extension.

Open your Amiga project's folder. Add these workspace settings to
`.vscode/settings.json`, replacing the example paths with absolute paths to
your build. Each setting names an executable file, not its directory:

```json
{
  "copperline.ctlExecutable": "/absolute/path/to/Copperline/target/release/copperline-ctl",
  "copperline.emulatorExecutable": "/absolute/path/to/Copperline/target/release/copperline"
}
```

On Windows, JSON paths can use forward slashes, for example
`C:/src/Copperline/target/release/copperline.exe`.

## Build and launch an Amiga program

Use your existing vasm, amiga-gcc, or ELF/elf2hunk project. For a new project,
run **Copperline: Init Amiga Project**, choose a destination and toolchain,
then open that folder. The generated **Copperline: Build** task builds
`demo`; the Bartman toolchain option also produces `demo.elf`. Its compiler
can be detected through the installed Bartman extension. Other toolchains
can be selected independently.

For that generated project, use the following `.vscode/launch.json`. It
selects a predictable A500 with AROS, regardless of saved launcher defaults:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "copperline",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Copperline: A500 source debugging",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/demo",
      "preLaunchTask": "Copperline: Build",
      "factory": true,
      "model": "A500",
      "chip": "1M",
      "slow": "512K",
      "entryPoint": "main",
      "stopOnEntry": true,
      "noAudio": true
    }
  ]
}
```

For an existing project, change `program` to the actual Amiga hunk executable
and `preLaunchTask` to its build task, or omit the task if you build separately.
For an ELF/elf2hunk build, keep the matching ELF beside the executable or set
`symbolFile` explicitly. For example, Bartman's template uses
`"program": "${workspaceFolder}/out/a.exe"` and
`"symbolFile": "${workspaceFolder}/out/a.elf"` with `preLaunchTask` set to
`compile`. The native adapter's `program` includes the executable suffix;
Bartman's own launch configuration uses the base name instead.

Build with debug information (`-g` or vasm's `-linedebug`). Use `-O0` when
examining C variables: optimization can remove locals or reorder source
statements. Keep optimized builds for measuring the code you intend to ship.
The [debug information reference](dap.md#debug-information) lists supported
formats and toolchain limitations, including newer amiga-gcc linkers that
discard DWARF when writing hunk files.

## Stop, inspect, and step back

1. Select **Copperline: A500 source debugging** in **Run and Debug**, then
   press **F5**. The emulator boots, loads the program, and stops at `main`.
2. Click the source gutter to set a breakpoint on an executable statement.
   Continue to it, then use **Step Over**, **Step Into**, or **Step Out**.
3. Expand the variables and call stack. Select a caller to inspect that
   frame's source and variables. Open **Disassembly** from the editor's
   debug context menu to compare source with the actual 68k instructions.
4. Use **Step Back** to inspect the preceding execution state. Memory and
   registers follow the restored machine state; see [Reverse debugging](reverse.md).

```

This screenshot uses a small unoptimized test program, so its function names
and values differ from the generated graphics demo. It demonstrates the
multi-file DWARF relocation support, including relocatable ELF builds.

Expand **Custom Registers** for chipset state and hover a register for its
access rules and bit fields. The debug toolbar also opens Copperline's
native **Debugger**, **Console**, and **Frame Analyzer** windows.

## Capture a CPU profile

While paused in the loaded program, click **Profile** in the debug toolbar
for one emulated frame, or **Profile (Multi)** to choose a frame count.
Copperline opens a source-mapped `.cpuprofile` in VS Code. A `[Bus wait]`
child separates chip-DMA contention from CPU work in a function.

For bitmap previews, blitter channels, and the combined CPU/DMA timeline,
use the separate [Bartman profiling walkthrough](vscode-bartman.md#capture-and-explore-a-frame).
See [Instruction profiling](profiling.md) for capture formats and automation,
and [the DAP reference](dap.md) for all launch and attach options.

(view-guest-coverage)=
## View guest coverage

Add `coverage` to the launch configuration to have the emulator collect
line and function coverage of the program from its first instruction to its
exit, written as an lcov `.info` file (the emulator's
[`--coverage`](profiling.md#guest-coverage) run):

```json
{
  "type": "copperline",
  "request": "launch",
  "name": "Copperline: coverage",
  "program": "${workspaceFolder}/demo",
  "coverage": "${workspaceFolder}/lcov.info",
  "sourceMap": { "/build/src": "${workspaceFolder}" },
  "stopOnEntry": false,
  "noAudio": true
}
```

The file is written when the program exits or when the session is stopped,
with `sourceMap` applied to its paths. Two ways to see it:

- **Coverage Gutters** (`ryanluker.vscode-coverage-gutters`) watches
  `lcov.info` in the workspace by default (`coverage-gutters.coverageFileNames`
  adds other names); **Coverage Gutters: Display Coverage** paints the
  gutters and **Watch** keeps them current across runs.
- VS Code's built-in coverage view: run **Copperline: Show Coverage** from
  the command palette (or **Run Tests with Coverage** on the *Copperline
  Coverage* item in the Test Explorer). The command asks for the `.info`
  file, then VS Code's Test Coverage panel lists each source file with its
  line and function percentages and the editor shows per-line hit counts
  and uncovered lines.

For a static report, `genhtml lcov.info -o coverage-html` from the lcov
package renders the same file. The file's leading `#` lines account for
instructions the program retired outside any known source line, such as an
assembly startup stub, and for the Kickstart's own instructions.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| VS Code cannot start the adapter or emulator | Both executable paths, file permissions, and the Windows `.exe` suffix. Rebuild both binaries from the same Copperline checkout. |
| AROS ROM cannot be found | Keep the source checkout's `assets/aros` directory, or copy it to `aros` beside a relocated executable. |
| Breakpoints stay unbound or source is missing | The loaded hunk and ELF must come from the same build. Keep `-g`; set `symbolFile` for a differently named ELF. Use `sourceMap` for sources moved since compilation. |
| Locals are optimized out | Rebuild with `-O0`, then stop and relaunch. A profile of an optimized build can still have useful source attribution. |
| The machine differs from the example | Keep `factory: true`, or deliberately select an explicit Copperline config. |
| Bartman settings seem to have no effect | This adapter uses `type: copperline` and `copperline.*` settings. The separate Bartman adapter uses `type: amiga` and `amiga.*` settings. |
