//! Save-state resume regression: a resumed run must be byte-identical to an
//! uninterrupted one (docs/guide/headless.md, "Save states").
//!
//! The emulator core is deterministic and independent of wall-clock pacing,
//! so two machines that reach the same emulated instant through different
//! histories -- one stepped straight through, one restored at T from a state
//! written by another machine -- must hold identical memory and produce
//! identical frames from then on. Any difference means some machine state is
//! missing from (or corrupted by) the save-state format.
//!
//! One deliberate exception shapes the comparisons below: the state loader
//! launders the per-frame render-capture buffers
//! (`Bus::reset_transient_video_after_state_load`, see the module comment in
//! src/savestate.rs), so the FIRST post-resume frame re-renders from rebuilt
//! capture state and its pixels are not comparable; its machine state is.
//! From the next frame wrap on, the capture buffers rebuild identically and
//! every fingerprint field must match. The checkpoints reflect that: frame
//! +1 compares timeline and chip RAM, later frames compare everything.
//!
//! Asset-free: the bundled AROS ROM boots with an empty DF0, no disk image
//! needed. The guest clock is pinned with a fixed RTC seed so separate
//! machine builds agree (an unseeded clock reads the host wall clock).
//!
//! Fingerprints follow the control protocol's `capture.digest` recipe
//! (src/control/exec.rs): FNV-1a over the side-effect-free display-path
//! framebuffer chained with FNV-1a over chip RAM. The render input is built
//! fresh per capture (`RenderInput::from_bus`) so the digest is a pure
//! function of machine state, not of this thread's capture history --
//! `render_display_only` would reuse a thread-local input that refills
//! incrementally across whatever machines were captured before.
//!
//! Release-only, like tests/probe_golden.rs: a debug-build emulator is far
//! too slow for multi-second emulated boots.
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo test --release --test savestate_roundtrip -- --nocapture
//! ```
