# Browser netplay rooms

This Cloudflare Worker exchanges WebRTC connection descriptions between two
players, and between a host and its spectators. Each SQLite Durable Object
holds one invitation for at most 15 minutes; a spectator "watch room" stays
alive while the host keeps polling it.
Game inputs and host-to-guest setup files use encrypted WebRTC directly or
through TURN. ROMs and disks never pass through this signaling Worker; running
snapshots are not transferred. The static site remains on GitHub Pages.

## Deploy

Use Node 24 or later. Install the pinned tools with `npm ci`, authenticate with
`npx wrangler login`, and review the allowed site origins in `wrangler.jsonc`.
Create a TURN key in Cloudflare Realtime and store its values as Worker secrets:

```sh
npx wrangler secret put TURN_KEY_ID
npx wrangler secret put TURN_KEY_API_TOKEN
npm run deploy
```

The first deployment creates the SQLite Durable Object namespace. Put the
deployed HTTPS URL in the site shell:

```html
<meta name="copperline-netplay-service" content="https://YOUR-WORKER.workers.dev">
```

The URL is public configuration. Never put the TURN key or its API token in the
site, source, logs or GitHub variables exposed to browsers. Temporary credentials
are issued for each player and last 24 hours. They are not refreshed; longer
games need a new session. Keep `REQUIRE_TURN` enabled in production: if TURN
credential issuance fails, room creation reports an error rather than presenting
a connection with no relay fallback.
The service removes Cloudflare's alternate port 53 URLs, which browsers can
block and leave address discovery waiting until it times out. Other relay
ports, including TLS on port 443, remain available.
Browsers that reject TURN transport queries retry with default UDP and TLS URLs;
plain TCP entries are omitted only for those browsers.
If discovery reaches its 15-second deadline with usable candidates, the browser
proceeds with those routes instead of waiting for every configured server.

The WASM publishing workflow copies all netplay modules and the QR license to
the site. It leaves the site's HTML, service URL and service worker intact.
Worker changes are deployed separately with `npm run deploy`.

## Limits and operations

Invitations carry 128 random bits and admit one guest. Separate owner and guest
tokens authorize changes; knowing the room ID alone does not grant host access.
The first guest reservation wins, so share links only with the intended player.
Setup expires after 15 minutes and DELETE removes it early. An established game
continues independently of the signaling record. Closing a page attempts cleanup;
expiry handles interrupted requests or suspended devices.

Bodies are limited to 100 KiB and connection codes to 96 KiB. The service permits
6 room creations and 120 total room requests per minute per client IP, using
Cloudflare's per-location rate limiter. The browser polls every 1.5 seconds only
while waiting for an answer. Shared networks share these quotas. CORS restricts
browser origins; it does not authenticate non-browser clients. Avoid treating
the quota as a global spending cap.

Application logging is disabled and exceptions do not include provider messages
or credentials. The Worker provider still handles request metadata. Check
`GET /health` with an allowed `Origin` header for the service version and whether
TURN secrets are configured; this does not test credential validity. A room
creation and a relay-only browser session verify the actual relay path.

Cloudflare's [Realtime pricing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/sfu/pricing/)
has a shared SFU/TURN free allowance, followed by usage charges. Review current
account limits and billing before enabling paid usage. The Worker and Durable
Objects have their own quotas. There is no payment or plan upgrade in the deploy
script.

## Local checks

```sh
npm ci
npm test
npx wrangler deploy --dry-run
npm run dev -- --env local
```

Local mode allows `http://127.0.0.1:8765`, disables TURN and makes no credential
requests. Serve the site there, then run `node tools/check-web-netplay-rooms.mjs`
from the repository root. The tool supplies the local service URL without editing
the deployable page. Its `NETPLAY_SERVICE` and `NETPLAY_RELAY_ONLY=1` options test
an explicitly selected deployed service and require a selected relay candidate.
`NETPLAY_GATHER_DEADLINE_TEST=1` exercises the discovery deadline with real
candidates and connectivity while holding the exposed gathering state open.

The Node tests run the Worker and Durable Objects in Miniflare, checking role
boundaries, guest reservation, cleanup, request limits and TURN failure handling.
An independent decoder checks the vendored QR encoder. Browser helper tests live
in `crates/copperline-web/www`; run `npm test` there too.

## Watch rooms

A host creates a second room for spectators with `POST /watch`
(`{ "slots": 1..8 }`; the page always asks for 8), keyed by its own
22-character token: a spectator link
(`#watch=`) never reaches `/rooms/{id}/join`, and a player room id opens no
watch room. Signaling runs the other way round from player rooms:

| Route | Who | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /watch` | anyone (creation quota) | `{ id, owner, expiresAt, iceServers }` |
| `POST /watch/{id}/join` `{ spectator }` | anyone with the link | reserves one of `slots` places and issues that spectator's TURN credentials; 409 when full |
| `POST /watch/{id}/offer` `{ code }` | spectator token | stores the spectator's offer |
| `GET /watch/{id}/offers` | owner | unanswered offers; extends the room by 15 minutes and prunes stale entries |
| `POST /watch/{id}/answer` `{ spectator, code }` | owner | stores the answer |
| `POST /watch/{id}/refuse` `{ spectator }` | owner | turns an offered spectator away: its next `GET .../answer` says `refused` and its place is freed |
| `GET /watch/{id}/answer` | spectator token | the answer once available; the first fetch frees the place, and the answer stays readable for a minute so a lost response can be retried |
| `DELETE /watch/{id}` | owner | ends the room |

The host page opens the watch room together with its player room. The
service counts only places still in signaling, so a host whose places are
all watching refuses further offers itself.

Entries are stored per spectator, never as one growing record. An unanswered
offer expires after 10 minutes, an unfetched answer after 2, and a fetched
answer after 1. The host
page polls every 2 seconds only while its machine runs, and spectators poll
every 2.5 seconds with a 5-second backoff on 429, so several spectators
behind one address share the request quota without failing. The room's TTL
is extended by every owner poll and it expires 15 minutes after the host
stops polling.
