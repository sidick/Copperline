//! A minimal SD memory card, emulated in SPI mode.
//!
//! Backs the SF2000 accelerator's Zorro SD card controller
//! (`crate::sf2000sd`) with a real block image through
//! [`crate::harddrive::HardDriveImage`] -- the same raw 512-byte-sector
//! backend `ata.rs`/`a2091.rs` already use, so an SD card image is handled
//! exactly like a `[lide]`/`[copperhf]` hardfile (RDB images, bare-partition
//! hardfiles with a synthesized RDB, gzip-compressed images).
//!
//! Implements the SD-over-SPI command set the driver actually issues, verified
//! against Mike Stirling's `sd.c` (`k1208-drivers`, also used by `spisd2` for
//! the SF2000): CMD0/CMD8/CMD55+ACMD41/CMD58 (the init handshake), CMD9/CMD10
//! (CSD/CID), CMD13 (status), CMD16 (accepted no-op -- block length is always
//! 512), CMD17/CMD24 (single-block read/write), CMD18/CMD25/CMD12 (multi-block
//! read/write/stop -- the path any trackdisk-style request wider than one
//! sector takes, which is the common case, not an edge case: `device.c`
//! passes `io_Length >> 9` straight through as the sector count), ACMD23 (its
//! result is never checked by the driver, so it falls through to the
//! catch-all "unknown command" response harmlessly), CMD59 (accepted no-op --
//! CRC checking is never enforced, including on CMD0/CMD8's
//! normally-mandatory fixed CRC bytes: a permissive card is friendlier for
//! driver bring-up than a strict one).
//!
//! Presented throughout as a block-addressed (SDHC-style) card: CMD8 and
//! ACMD41's HCS bit and CMD58's OCR CCS bit all say so, so a real driver
//! always addresses it by block number, matching `HardDriveImage`'s own
//! `u64` LBA unit directly -- no byte-address/block-address branch needed.
//!
//! ## The `clock_byte` model
//!
//! Every SPI byte-time is bidirectional on the real bus: MOSI and MISO both
//! carry a bit on each SCLK edge. `sdcard.v`'s TX/RX/BOTH shifter "mode" is a
//! local FPGA buffering convenience, not a bus-level distinction -- in TX
//! mode the shifter still receives a byte from the card each byte-time, it
//! just discards it instead of pushing it to the RX FIFO; in RX mode it
//! still drives real clock edges, it just always sends `0xFF` filler.
//! [`SdCard::clock_byte`] models the one true primitive: given the byte the
//! host is driving onto MOSI this byte-time, advance the card's
//! command/response state machine and return the byte it drives back onto
//! MISO. `crate::sf2000sd::Sf2000Sd` calls it once per byte-time regardless
//! of which RTL "mode" is active, discarding the reply on a TX-only byte
//! exactly as the real shifter does.
//!
//! Response timing (Ncr, the gap between a command and its reply, and the
//! similar gap before a data token) is collapsed to zero: a real card may
//! take a few filler bytes to answer, and every real driver's init/poll loop
//! already tolerates that, so answering immediately is still spec-legal and
//! keeps the model simple. A short fixed run of busy (`0x00`) bytes after a
//! block write stands in for real flash program time, so a driver's
//! busy-poll path is still exercised.
