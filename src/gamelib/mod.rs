//! The WHDLoad game library: a list of the packages you have, what the
//! OpenRetro game database says about them, and the sync that fetches it.
//!
//! Compiled only with the `game-library` feature. Apart from the About
//! panel's update check (`crate::update`), it is the one part of Copperline
//! that talks to the internet on its own account, and it shares that
//! check's HTTP client and TLS stack (`crate::http`), so a build with
//! neither feature links neither and carries none of this. WHDLoad itself
//! does not depend on any of it: a package still boots from a path in the
//! configuration exactly the same way.
//!
//! Deliberately self-contained. Nothing here reaches into the emulator, and
//! the rest of Copperline reaches in through a small surface: the launcher
//! asks for the list, for one game's details, and for a sync to be run.
