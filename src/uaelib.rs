//! WinUAE-compatible "uaelib" trap: a guest-callable emulator service at
//! `$F0FF60`.
//!
//! WinUAE's boot ROM ("rtarea", `autoconf.cpp`) carries a trap word at
//! `rtarea_base + 0xFF60` that `uaelib_demux` (`uaelib.cpp`) services: guest
//! code calls it like a C function with the function number as the first
//! stack argument (`uae-configuration`, `uaequit`, and the vscode-amiga-debug
//! template's `warpmode()`, `KPrintF()` and `debug_*()` helpers all go through
//! it). Copperline answers the same ABI at the same address so that code
//! works unchanged:
//!
//! - **82** `cfgfile_uaelib_modify(index, parms, size, out, outsize)`: a
//!   `"key value"` configuration line. The only key that does anything here
//!   is `warp` (`true`/`yes`/`false`/`no`), which latches a warp request for
//!   the frontend; the template's `cpu_speed` and `*_cycle_exact` keys are
//!   accepted and ignored because the core is always cycle-exact.
//! - **86** `write_log("DBG: %s")`: a debug line, echoed to the host
//!   console like serial output and queued for control-protocol
//!   subscribers.
//! - **88** the template's `debug_cmd` multiplexer: resource registration
//!   (bitmaps, palettes, copper lists) and idle markers are recorded for the
//!   control protocol; overlay drawing is presented by the window. File
//!   load/save is disabled unless `[emulation] uaelib_files = true`, and is
//!   then confined to the `--run` program directory.
//! - **13** WinUAE's `ExitEmu`: the guest asks the emulator to stop. The
//!   request is latched for the frontend, which ends the session cleanly
//!   (exit status 0, or 3 if a screenshot expectation had failed).
//! - everything else returns 0 with no side effects (Copperline does not
//!   impersonate WinUAE's version through function 0).
//!
//! Nothing here models Amiga hardware. The trap is a 32-byte ROM-like
//! region decoded by the CPU bus adapter after every real device; the only
//! writable word is a doorbell the stub rings with the caller's stack
//! pointer, and the call is serviced synchronously inside that write, the
//! same way the services board handles a DosPacket (`src/filesys.rs`).
//! Unlike WinUAE, which intercepts an A-line opcode in the CPU core, no
//! CPU-side hook exists: the stub is ordinary 68k code.
//!
//! ```text
//! +00  4EB9 00F0FF68   JSR ($00F0FF68).L        first word 0x4EB9: the template's detection
//! +06  4E75            RTS                      back to the C caller
//! +08  23CF 00F0FF7C   MOVE.L A7,($00F0FF7C).L  doorbell = A7 (ARGn at A7+8+4n: two returns deep)
//! +0E  2039 00F0FF78   MOVE.L ($00F0FF78).L,D0  result the host latched during the doorbell write
//! +14  4E75            RTS
//! +16  0000            pad (the 68000 prefetches two words past an RTS)
//! +18  result latch    (host-written, guest-readable)
//! +1C  doorbell latch  (guest-written; a 68000 lands the high word first)
//! ```
//!
//! The guest sees D0 (the result) and the CCR clobbered, which is what a C
//! caller expects of a function; WinUAE preserves more. The result latch is
//! global, so a uaelib call made from an interrupt handler between the
//! doorbell write and the result read would clobber the interrupted
//! call's D0. A CDTV extended ROM at `$F00000` decodes ahead of this region
//! and hides it, as WinUAE relocates its rtarea on that machine.
